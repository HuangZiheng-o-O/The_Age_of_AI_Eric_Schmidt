最近两天全球科技圈的热点，被谷歌前CEO埃里克·施密特(Eric Schmidt)无意中抢走。他受邀去斯坦福计算机学院做一场交流，埃里克·施密特以为是一场内部分享，或许也加上当天心情不错，全程放飞自我，直到主办方提醒正在直播，结果……埃里克·施密特虽然当场石化，但却意外成就了一次“大实话、高营养”的演讲。

埃里克·施密特的演讲主要谈及：AI 技术和市场的动态；AI的投资与国家安全；谷歌、OpenAI与企业文化；AI与地缘政治；战争与AI的应用；知识的本质与AI；AI隐私以及数据安全；以及AI对教育和学术研究，创业与就业的影响……

today's guest really does need an introduction. I think I first met Eric about 25 years ago when he came to Stanford Business School as CEO of Novell. He's had done a few things since then at Google starting I think 2001 and Schmidt Futures starting in 2017 and done a whole bunch of other things you can read about, but he can only be here until 5/15, so I thought we'd dive right into some questions, and I know you guys have sent some as well. I have a bunch written here, but what we just talked about upstairs was even more interesting, so I'm just going to start with that, Eric, if that's okay, which is where do you see AI going in the short term, which I think you defined as the next year or two? Things have changed so fast, I feel like every six months I need to sort of give a new speech on what's going to happen.  
今天的嘉宾确实需要介绍一下。我想我第一次见到埃里克是在 25 年前，当时他作为 Novell 的首席执行官来到斯坦福商学院。从那时起，他在谷歌做了一些事情，我想是从 2001 年开始的，2017 年开始的 Schmidt Futures，还做了一大堆其他事情，你们可以读读这些事情，但他只能在这里待到 5 月 15 日，所以我想我们可以直接进入一些问题，我知道你们也发来了一些问题。我这里已经写了很多问题，但我们刚才在楼上谈的问题更有意思，所以我就从这个问题开始吧，埃里克，如果可以的话，你认为人工智能在短期内（我想你把它定义为未来一两年）的发展方向是什么？事情变化得太快了，我觉得每六个月我都需要就即将发生的事情发表一次新的演讲。

Can anybody hear the computer, the budget computer science engineer, can anybody explain what a million-token context window is for the rest of the class? You're here. Say your name, tell us what it does. Basically it allows you to prompt with like a million tokens or a million words or whatever. So you can ask a million-word question.  
有谁能听到计算机的声音吗？预算计算机科学工程师，有谁能为班上其他同学解释一下什么是百万令牌上下文窗口吗？你来了说说你的名字，告诉我们它是做什么的。基本上，它允许你用一百万个标记或一百万个单词来提示。所以你可以问一个百万字的问题

Yes, I know this is a very large direction in January now. No, no, they're going to 10. Yes, a couple of them. Anthropic is at 200,000 going to a million and so forth. You can imagine OpenAI has a similar goal.  
是的，我知道这是现在一月份一个非常大的方向。不，不，他们要去10。是的，一对夫妇。Anthropic 的目标是 20 万到 100 万不等。你可以想象 OpenAI 也有类似的目标。

Can anybody here give a technical definition of an AI agent? Yes, sir. So an agent is something that does some kind of a task. Another definition would be that it's an LLM state in memory. Can anybody, again, computer scientists, can any of you define text to action?  
这里有人能给出人工智能代理的技术定义吗？可以，先生。代理就是能完成某种任务的东西。另一个定义是，它是内存中的 LLM 状态。计算机科学家们，你们中有人能给 "文本到行动 "下个定义吗？

Taking text and turning it into an action? Right here. Go ahead. Yes, instead of taking text and turning it into more text, more text, taking text and have the AI trigger actions. So another definition would be language to Python, a programming language I never wanted to see survive and everything in AI is being done in Python.  
将文字转化为行动？就在这里说吧是的，不是把文字变成更多的文字，更多的文字，而是把文字变成人工智能触发的动作。所以，另一个定义就是 Python 语言，一种我从未想看到的编程语言，人工智能的一切都在 Python 语言中完成。

There's a new language called Mojo that has just come out, which looks like they finally have addressed AI programming, but we'll see if that actually survives over the dominance of Python. One more technical question. Why is NVIDIA worth $2 trillion and the other companies are struggling? Technical answer. I mean, I think it just boils down to like most of the code needs to run with CUDA optimizations that currently only NVIDIA GPU supports.  
有一种名为 Mojo 的新语言刚刚问世，看起来他们终于解决了人工智能编程的问题，但我们将拭目以待，看看这种语言是否真的能战胜 Python 的统治。还有一个技术问题。为什么英伟达价值 2 万亿美元，而其他公司却举步维艰？技术答案。我的意思是，我认为这可以归结为大部分代码都需要运行 CUDA 优化，而目前只有英伟达™（NVIDIA®）GPU 支持这种优化。

Other companies can make whatever they want to, but unless they have the 10 years of software there, you don't have the machine learning optimization. I like to think of CUDA as the C programming language for GPUs. That's the way I like to think of it. It was founded in 2008. I always thought it was a terrible language and yet it's become dominant.  
其他公司想做什么就能做什么，但除非他们有 10 年的软件经验，否则就无法进行机器学习优化。我喜欢把 CUDA 视为 GPU 的 C 编程语言。我就是这么想的。它创立于 2008 年。我一直认为这是一门糟糕的语言，但它却成为了主流。

There's another insight. There's a set of open source libraries which are highly optimized to CUDA and not anything else and everybody who builds all these stacks, this is completely missed in any of the discussions. It's technically called VLM and a whole bunch of libraries like that. Highly optimized CUDA, very hard to replicate that if you're a competitor. So what does all this mean?  
还有另一种见解。有一组开源库针对 CUDA 进行了高度优化，而不是其他任何东西，而构建所有这些堆栈的每个人在讨论中都完全忽略了这一点。从技术上讲，这就是所谓的 VLM 和一大堆类似的库。高度优化的 CUDA，如果你是竞争对手，就很难复制。那么，这一切意味着什么？

In the next year, you're going to see very large context windows, agents and text action. When they are delivered at scale, it's going to have an impact on the world at a scale that no one understands yet. Much bigger than the horrific impact we've had by social media in my view. So here's why. In a context window, you can basically use that as short-term memory and I was shocked that context windows get this long.  
明年，你将看到非常大的上下文窗口、代理和文本操作。当它们被大规模应用时，将会对世界产生巨大的影响，而这种影响的程度还没有人能够理解。在我看来，这比社交媒体给我们带来的可怕影响要大得多。原因就在这里。在上下文窗口中，你基本上可以把它当作短期记忆来使用。

The technical reasons have to do with the fact that it's hard to serve, hard to calculate and so forth. The interesting thing about short-term memory is when you feed, you're asking a question read 20 books, you give it the text of the books as the query and you say, tell me what they say. It forgets the middle, which is exactly how human brains work too. That's where we are. With respect to agents, there are people who are now building essentially LLM agents and the way they do it is they read something like chemistry, they discover the principles of chemistry and then they test it and then they add that back into their understanding.  
技术上的原因与它难以服务、难以计算等事实有关。短时记忆的有趣之处在于，当你提出一个阅读 20 本书的问题时，你可以给它这些书的文本作为询问，然后你说，告诉我它们都说了什么。它就会忘记中间的内容，这也正是人类大脑的工作原理。我们就是这样。关于代理，现在有些人正在建立本质上的LLM代理，他们这样做的方式是，他们阅读化学之类的东西，发现化学原理，然后进行测试，再将其加入到他们的理解中。

That's extremely powerful. And then the third thing, as I mentioned is text to action. So I'll give you an example. The government is in the process of trying to ban TikTok. We'll see if that actually happens.  
这一点非常强大。第三件事，正如我提到的，就是 "文本到行动"。我给你举个例子。政府正在试图禁止 TikTok。我们拭目以待。

If TikTok is banned, here's what I propose each and every one of you do. Say to your LLM the following. Make me a copy of TikTok, steal all the users, steal all the music, put my preferences in it, produce this program in the next 30 seconds, release it and in one hour, if it's not viral, do something different along the same lines. That's the command. Boom, boom, boom, boom.  
如果 TikTok 被禁用，我建议你们每个人都这么做。对你们的LLM说以下的话。给我拷贝一份 TikTok，窃取所有的用户，窃取所有的音乐，把我的喜好放进去，在接下来的 30 秒内制作出这个程序，发布出去，一个小时后，如果它还没有病毒式传播，就按照同样的思路做一些不同的事情。这就是命令。嘣，嘣，嘣，嘣

You understand how powerful that is. If you can go from arbitrary language to arbitrary digital command, which is essentially what Python in this scenario is, imagine that each and every human on the planet has their own programmer that actually does what they want as opposed to the programmers that work for me who don't do what I ask, right? The programmers here know what I'm talking about. So imagine a non-arrogant programmer that actually does what you want and you don't have to pay all that money to and there's infinite supply of these programs. That's all within the next year or two.  
你知道这有多么强大。如果你能从任意语言变成任意数字命令，而 Python 在这种情况下基本上就是这样，想象一下，地球上的每一个人都有自己的程序员，他们会真正按照自己的意愿行事，而不是那些为我工作的程序员，他们不会按照我的要求行事，对吗？这里的程序员知道我在说什么。所以，想象一下，一个不傲慢的程序员能真正做到你想要的，你也不用花那么多钱，而且这些程序的供应量是无限的。这一切都在未来一两年内。

Very soon. Those three things, and I'm quite convinced it's the union of those three things that will happen in the next wave. So you asked about what else is going to happen. Every six months I oscillate. So we're on a, it's an even odd oscillation.  
很快。这三件事，我深信这三件事的结合将在下一波浪潮中发生。所以，你问我还会发生什么。每六个月我都会摇摆一次。所以我们现在是偶数振荡。

So at the moment, the gap between the frontier models, which they're now only three, I'll refute who they are, and everybody else, appears to me to be getting larger. Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller. So I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I'm not so sure. And I'm talking to the big companies and the big companies are telling me that they need 10 billion, 20 billion, 50 billion, 100 billion.  
因此，目前在我看来，前沿模型（现在只有三个，我会驳斥他们是谁，）与其他人之间的差距越来越大。六个月前，我还坚信差距会越来越小。所以我在小公司身上投了很多钱。现在我不这么认为了。我跟大公司谈，大公司告诉我，他们需要100亿、200亿、500亿、1000亿。

Stargate is a 100 billion, right? That's very, very hard. I talked to Sam Altman is a close friend. He believes that it's going to take about 300 billion, maybe more. I pointed out to him that I'd done the calculation on the amount of energy required.  
星际之门是1000亿，对吧？这是非常，非常困难的。我跟山姆・奥特曼 是一个亲密的朋友。他认为需要3000亿 甚至更多我告诉他我计算过所需的能量了

And I, and I then in the spirit of full disclosure, went to the white house on Friday and told them that we need to become best friends with Canada because Canada has really nice people, helped invent AI, and lots of hydropower. Because we as a country do not have enough power to do this. The alternative is to have the Arabs fund it. And I like the Arabs personally. I spent lots of time there, right?  
然后，我本着完全公开的精神，在周五去了趟白宫，告诉他们我们需要和加拿大成为最好的朋友，因为加拿大人真的很好，帮助发明了人工智能，还有很多水电。因为作为一个国家，我们没有足够的能力做到这一点。另一种选择是让阿拉伯人出资。我个人很喜欢阿拉伯人。我在那里呆过很长时间，对吧？

But they're not going to adhere to our national security rules. Whereas Canada and the U.S. are part of a triumvirate where we all agree. So these $100 billion, $300 billion data centers, electricity starts becoming the scarce resource. Well, and by the way, if you follow this line of reasoning, why did I discuss CUDA and Nvidia?  
但他们不会遵守我们的国家安全规则。而加拿大和美国是三足鼎立的一部分，我们都同意。因此，这些价值1000亿、3000亿美元的数据中心，电力开始成为稀缺资源。好吧，顺便说一句，如果你按照这个思路推理，我为什么要讨论 CUDA 和 Nvidia 呢？

If $300 billion is all going to go to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market. Okay. That's not a stock recommendation. I'm not a licensed. Well, part of it, so we're going to need a lot more chips, but Intel is getting a lot of money from the U.S.  
如果 3,000 亿美元都给了 Nvidia，你就知道该怎么炒股了。好吧 Okay.这不是股票推荐我没拿到执照有一部分原因是，我们需要更多的芯片，但英特尔从美国获得了大量资金。

government, AMD, and they're trying to build, you know, fabs in Korea. Raise your hand if you have an Intel computer in your, an Intel chip in any of your computing devices. Okay. So much for the monopoly. Well, that's the point though.  
政府、AMD，他们正试图在韩国建立晶圆厂。如果你的电脑里有英特尔芯片，请举手 你的任何计算设备里都有英特尔芯片好了，垄断就到此为止了这就是问题所在

They once did have a monopoly. Absolutely. And Nvidia has a monopoly now. So are those barriers to entry, like CUDA, is that, is there something that other, so I was talking to Percy, Percy Landy the other day, he's switching between TPUs and Nvidia chips, depending on what he can get access to for training models. That's because he doesn't have a choice.  
他们曾经垄断过。当然现在Nvidia也垄断了市场。我前几天和珀西-兰迪（Percy Landy）聊天时，他在TPU和Nvidia芯片之间切换，这取决于他能用什么芯片来训练模型。这是因为他别无选择。

If he had infinite money, he would, today he would pick the B200 architecture out of Nvidia because it would be faster. And I'm not suggesting, I mean, it's great to have competition. I've talked to AMD and Lisa Sue at great length. They have built a, a thing which will translate from this CUDA architecture that you were describing to their own, which is called ROCm. It doesn't quite work yet.  
如果他有无限的钱，他今天就会选择 Nvidia 的 B200 架构，因为它更快。我不是在暗示，我是说，有竞争是件好事。我跟 AMD 和 Lisa Sue 交谈了很久。他们建立了一个，一个可以从你刚才描述的 CUDA 架构转换到他们自己的架构的东西，叫做 ROCm。目前还不能完全运行。

They're working on it. You were at Google for a long time and they invented the transformer architecture. Peter, Peter. It's all Peter's fault. Thanks to, to brilliant people over there, like Peter and Jeff Dean and everyone.  
他们正在研究。你在谷歌工作了很长时间，他们发明了变压器架构。彼得 彼得都是彼得的错都是彼得的功劳 多亏了彼得和杰夫-迪恩这些杰出的人

But now it doesn't seem like they're, they've kind of lost the initiative to open AI and even the last leaderboard, I saw Anthropix. Claude was at the top of the list. I asked Sundar this, he didn't really give me a very sharp answer. Maybe, maybe you have a sharper or a more objective explanation for what's going on there. I'm no longer a Google employee in the spirit of full disclosure.  
但现在看来，他们已经失去了开放人工智能的主动权，甚至在上次的排行榜上，我看到 Anthropix.克劳德名列榜首。我问过桑达尔，他并没有给我一个非常尖锐的答案。也许，也许你有更犀利或更客观的解释。本着全面公开的精神，我不再是谷歌员工了。

Google decided that work life balance and going home early and working from home was more important than winning. And the startups, the reason startups work is because the people work like hell. And I'm sorry to be so blunt, but the fact of the matter is if you all leave the university and go found a company, you're not going to let people work from home and only come in one day a week. If you want to compete against the other startups with the early days of Google, Microsoft was like that. Exactly.  
谷歌认为，工作与生活的平衡、早回家和在家工作比获胜更重要。而初创企业之所以能成功，是因为人们拼命工作。很抱歉我说得这么直白，但事实是，如果你们都离开大学去创办一家公司，你们就不会让员工在家工作，一周只来一天。如果你想与其他初创公司竞争，早期的谷歌、微软都是这样。正是如此。

But now it seems to be, there's a long history of in my industry, our industry, I guess, of companies winning in a genuinely creative way and really dominating a space and not making this the next transition. So we're very well documented. And I think that the truth is founders are special. The founders need to be in charge. The founders are difficult to work with.  
但现在看来，在我所在的行业、我们的行业，我想，公司以真正有创意的方式获胜并真正主导一个领域，而不是将此作为下一个过渡的历史由来已久。因此，我们有据可查。我认为，事实是创始人很特别。创始人需要掌权。创始人很难共事。

They push people hard. As much as we can dislike Elon's personal behavior, look at what he gets out of people. I had dinner with him and he was flying. I was in Montana. He was flying that night at 10 PM to have a meeting at midnight with x.ai.  
他们逼人太甚。尽管我们可以不喜欢埃隆的个人行为，但看看他从人们身上得到了什么。我和他共进晚餐时，他正在飞行。我当时在蒙大拿州。他当晚 10 点的飞机，午夜要和 x.ai 开会。

I was in Taiwan, different country, different culture. And they said that this is TSMC, who I'm very impressed with. And they have a rule that the starting PhDs coming out of the good physicists work in the factory on the basement floor. Now, can you imagine getting American physicists to do that? The PhDs, highly unlikely.  
我当时在台湾，不同的国家，不同的文化。他们说，这就是台积电，我对他们印象深刻。他们有一条规定，优秀物理学家培养出来的新博士要在工厂的地下室工作。你能想象让美国物理学家这样做吗？博士们，不太可能。

Different work ethic. And the problem here, the reason I'm being so harsh about work is that these are systems which have network effects. So time matters a lot. And in most businesses, time doesn't matter that much. You have lots of time.  
不同的职业道德。这里的问题是，我之所以对工作如此苛刻，是因为这些系统具有网络效应。因此，时间非常重要。而在大多数企业中，时间并不那么重要。你有很多时间。

Coke and Pepsi will still be around and the fight between Coke and Pepsi will continue to go on and it's all glacial. When I dealt with telcos, the typical telco deal would take 18 months to sign. There's no reason to take 18 months to do anything. Get it done. We're in a period of maximum growth, maximum gain.  
可口可乐和百事可乐仍将存在，可口可乐和百事可乐之间的斗争仍将继续，一切都如冰火两重天。当我与电信公司打交道时，一般的电信公司交易需要 18 个月才能签署。没有理由用 18 个月来做任何事情。快去做吧。我们正处于增长最快、收益最大的时期。

And also it takes crazy ideas. Like when Microsoft did the OpenAI deal, I thought that was the stupidest idea I'd ever heard. Outsourcing essentially your AI leadership to OpenAI and Sam and his team. I mean, that's insane. Nobody would do that at Microsoft or anywhere else.  
这还需要疯狂的想法。就像微软与OpenAI的交易一样，我认为这是我听过的最愚蠢的想法。把人工智能的领导权外包给OpenAI和山姆及其团队。我的意思是，这太疯狂了。在微软或其他地方，没人会这么做。

And yet today, they're on their way to being the most valuable company. They're certainly head to head in Apple. Apple does not have a good AI solution and it looks like they made it work. Yes, sir. In terms of national security or geopolitical interests, how do you think AI is going to play a role or competition with China as well?  
然而今天，他们正在成为最有价值的公司。他们无疑是苹果公司的头号竞争对手。苹果公司没有一个好的人工智能解决方案，看起来他们成功了。是的，先生。在国家安全或地缘政治利益方面，你认为人工智能将如何发挥作用或与中国竞争？

So I was the chairman of an AI commission that sort of looked at this very carefully and you can read it. It's about 752 pages and I'll just summarize it by saying we're ahead, we need to stay ahead, and we need lots of money to do so. Our customers were the Senate and the House. And out of that came the Chips Act and a lot of other stuff like that. A rough scenario is that if you assume the frontier models drive forward and a few of the open source models, it's likely that a very small number of companies can play this game.  
我曾是一个人工智能委员会的主席，该委员会非常仔细地研究了这个问题，你可以读一读。它大约有 752 页，我只想总结一下，我们走在前面，我们需要保持领先，我们需要大量的资金来做到这一点。我们的客户是参议院和众议院。我们的客户是参议院和众议院，由此产生了《筹码法案》和许多其他类似的东西。一个粗略的假设是，如果你假定前沿模式和一些开源模式向前发展，那么可能只有极少数公司能玩这个游戏。

Countries, excuse me. What are those countries or who are they? Countries with a lot of money and a lot of talent, strong educational systems, and a willingness to win. The US is one of them. China is another one.  
国家，对不起。这些国家是什么国家？拥有大量资金、大量人才、强大的教育体系和取胜意愿的国家。美国就是其中之一。中国是另一个。

How many others are there? Are there any others? I don't know. Maybe. But certainly in your lifetimes, the battle between the US and China for knowledge supremacy is going to be the big fight.  
还有多少人？还有其他人吗？我不知道 也许吧 I don't know.也许吧但可以肯定的是，在你们的有生之年，中美之间的知识霸权之争将是一场大战。

So the US government banned essentially the NVIDIA chips, although they weren't allowed to say that was what they were doing, but they actually did that into China. They have about a 10-year chip advantage. We have a roughly 10-year chip advantage in terms of sub-DUV that is sub-five Danometer chips. So an example would be today we're a couple of years ahead of China. My guess is we'll get a few more years ahead of China, and the Chinese are whopping mad about this.  
因此，美国政府基本上禁止使用英伟达™（NVIDIA®）芯片，虽然他们不能说这是他们正在做的事情，但他们确实在中国这么做了。他们的芯片优势大约为 10 年。而我们在 5 Danometer 以下的 sub-DUV 芯片方面拥有大约 10 年的芯片优势。举例来说，今天我们比中国领先几年。我猜我们还能再领先中国几年，中国人对此非常生气。

It's like hugely upset about it. So that's a big deal. That was a decision made by the Trump administration and driven by the Biden administration. Do you find that the administration today in Congress is listening to your advice? Do you think that it's going to make that scale of investment?  
它就像对此感到非常不安。所以这是一件大事。这是特朗普政府做出的决定，也是拜登政府推动的决定。你觉得如今国会的政府会听取你的建议吗？你认为他们会进行如此大规模的投资吗？

Obviously the chips act, but beyond that, building a massive AI system? So as you know, I lead an informal, ad hoc, non-legal group. That's different from illegal. That's exactly. Just to be clear.  
显然是芯片法案，但除此之外，还要建立一个庞大的人工智能系统吗？如你所知，我领导着一个非正式的、特设的、非法的小组。 So as you know, I lead an informal, ad hoc, non -legal group.这和非法是两码事没错我只是想说清楚

Which includes all the usual suspects. And the usual suspects over the last year came up with the basis of the reasoning that became the Biden administration's AI act, which is the longest presidential directive in history. You're talking about the special competitive studies project? No, this is the actual act from the executive office. And they're busy implementing the details.  
其中包括所有常见的嫌疑人。在过去的一年里，这些惯常的嫌疑人提出了推理的基础，也就是拜登政府的人工智能法案，这是历史上最长的总统指令。你说的是特别竞争研究项目？不，这是行政办公室的实际法案。他们正忙着落实细节

So far they've got it right. And so, for example, one of the debates that we had for the last year has been, how do you detect danger in a system which has learned it but you don't know what to ask it? So in other words, it's a core problem. It's learned something bad, but it can't tell you what it learned and you don't know what to ask it. And there's so many threats.  
到目前为止，他们都做对了。因此，举例来说，去年我们讨论的一个问题就是，如何在一个已经学会了危险但却不知道该问它什么的系统中检测出危险？换句话说，这是一个核心问题。它学到了不好的东西，但却无法告诉你它学到了什么，而你又不知道该问它什么。而且还有很多威胁

Like it learned how to mix chemistry in some new way that you don't know how to ask it. And so people are working hard on that. But we ultimately wrote in our memos to them that there was a threshold which we arbitrarily named as 10 to the 26 flops, which technically is a measure of computation, that above that threshold you had to report to the government that you were doing this. And that's part of the rule. The EU to just make sure they were different did it 10 to the 25.  
就像它学会了如何以某种你不知道如何开口的新方式混合化学。因此，人们正在为此而努力。但我们最终在给他们的备忘录中写道，有一个阈值，我们任意命名为10到26次翻转，从技术上讲，这是一个计算的衡量标准，超过这个阈值，你必须向政府报告，你正在这样做。这也是规则的一部分。欧盟只是为了确保他们是不同的，做了10比25。

But it's all kind of close enough. I think all of these distinctions go away because the technology will now, the technical term is called federated training, where basically you can take pieces and union them together. So we may not be able to keep people safe from these new things. Well, rumors are that that's how OpenEye has had to train, partly because of the power consumption. There was no one place where they did.  
但这些都很接近。我认为所有这些区别都会消失，因为现在的技术，技术术语叫做联合训练，基本上你可以把碎片联合在一起。因此，我们可能无法保证人们免受这些新事物的影响。有传言说，OpenEye 就是这样进行训练的，部分原因是耗电。没有一个地方是这样的

Well, let's talk about a real war that's going on. I know that something you've been very involved in is the Ukraine war and in particular, I don't know if you can talk about white stork and your goal of having $500,000, $500 drones destroy $5 million tanks. How's that changing warfare? I worked for the Secretary of Defense for seven years and tried to change the way we run our military. I'm not a particularly big fan of the military, but it's very expensive and I wanted to see if I could be helpful.  
好吧，让我们来谈谈一场真正的战争。我知道你一直非常关注乌克兰战争，尤其是，我不知道你是否能谈谈白鹳和你的目标，即用50万美元、500美元的无人机摧毁价值500万美元的坦克。这将如何改变战争？我为国防部长工作了七年，试图改变我们管理军队的方式。我不是一个特别喜欢军队的人，但军队非常昂贵，我想看看我能不能帮上忙。

And I think in my view, I largely failed. They gave me a medal, so they must give medalists to failure or whatever. But my self-criticism was nothing has really changed and the system in America is not going to lead to real innovation. So watching the Russians use tanks to destroy apartment buildings with little old ladies and kids just drove me crazy. So I decided to work on a company with your friend Sebastian Thrun as a former faculty member here and a whole bunch of Stanford people.  
在我看来，我基本上是失败的。他们给了我一枚奖章，所以他们必须给失败者或其他什么人颁发奖章。但我的自我批评是，一切都没有真正改变，美国的制度不会带来真正的创新。看着俄国人用坦克摧毁公寓楼里的老太太和小孩，我简直要疯了。所以我决定和你的朋友塞巴斯蒂安-特伦（Sebastian Thrun）以及斯坦福的一帮人一起成立一家公司。

And the idea basically is to do two things. Use AI in complicated, powerful ways for these essentially robotic war and the second one is to lower the cost of the robots. Now you sit there and you go, why would a good liberal like me do that? And the answer is that the whole theory of armies is tanks, artilleries, and mortar and we can eliminate all of them and we can make the penalty for invading a country at least by land essentially be impossible. It should eliminate the kind of land battles.  
这个想法基本上是要做两件事。一是将人工智能以复杂、强大的方式用于机器人战争；二是降低机器人的成本。现在你坐在那里，你会问，为什么像我这样一个优秀的自由主义者会这么做？答案是，军队的全部理论就是坦克、火炮和迫击炮，我们可以消除所有这些东西，我们可以让入侵一个国家的惩罚至少在陆地上基本上是不可能的。这样就可以消除陆战。

Well, this is a relationship question is that does it give more of an advantage to defense versus offense? Can you even make that distinction? Because I've been doing this for the last year, I've learned a lot about war that I really did not want to know. And one of the things to know about war is that the offense always has the advantage because you can always overwhelm the defensive systems. And so you're better off as a strategy of national defense to have a very strong offense that you can use if you need to.  
那么，这是一个关系问题，它是否会给防守与进攻带来更多优势？你能做出这样的区分吗？因为我去年一直在做这件事，我学到了很多我本不想知道的战争知识。关于战争，要知道的一件事就是进攻方总是有优势，因为你总是能压倒防御系统。因此，作为国防战略，你最好拥有强大的进攻能力，以便在必要时使用。

And the systems that I and others are building will do that. Because of the way the system works, I am now a licensed arms dealer, a computer scientist, businessman, and an arms dealer. Is that a progression? I don't know. I do not recommend this in your group.  
而我和其他人正在建立的系统将做到这一点。由于该系统的运作方式，我现在是一名持证军火商、计算机科学家、商人和军火商。这是一种进步吗？我不知道。我不建议你们这样做。

I stick with AI. And because of the way the laws work, we're doing this privately and then this is all legal with the support of the governments. It goes straight into the Ukraine and then they fight the war. And without going into all the details, things are pretty bad. I think if in May or June, if the Russians build up as they are expecting to, Ukraine will lose a whole chunk of its territory and will begin the process of losing the whole country.  
我坚持使用人工智能。由于法律的规定，我们是私下进行的 而在政府的支持下，这些都是合法的。它直接进入乌克兰 然后他们就开战了不用细说，情况已经很糟糕了。我认为，如果俄罗斯人在 5 月或 6 月如期增兵，乌克兰将失去大片领土，并开始失去整个国家的进程。

So the situation is quite dire. And if anyone knows Marjorie Taylor Greene, I would encourage you to delete her from your contact list because she's the one, a single individual is blocking the provision of some number of billions of dollars to save an important democracy. I want to switch to a little bit of a philosophical question. So there was an article that you and Henry Kissinger and Dan Huttenlecker wrote last year about the nature of knowledge and how it's evolving. I had a discussion the other night about this as well.  
因此，情况相当严峻。如果有人认识马乔里-泰勒-格林（Marjorie Taylor Greene），我建议你把她从你的联系人名单中删除，因为就是她，一个人正在阻止提供数十亿美元来拯救一个重要的民主国家。我想问一个哲学问题。去年，你和亨利-基辛格、丹-胡滕莱克（Dan Huttenlecker）共同撰写了一篇关于知识的本质及其演变的文章。我前几天晚上也讨论过这个问题。

So for most of history, humans sort of had a mystical understanding of the universe and then there's the scientific revolution and the enlightenment. And in your article, you argue that now these models are becoming so complicated and difficult to understand that we don't really know what's going on in them. I'll take a quote from Richard Feynman. He says, "What I cannot create, I do not understand." I saw this quote the other day. But now people are creating things that they can create, but they don't really understand what's inside of them.  
因此，在历史上的大部分时间里，人类对宇宙都有一种神秘的理解，然后是科学革命和启蒙运动。在你的文章中，你认为现在这些模型变得如此复杂和难以理解 以至于我们都不知道其中到底发生了什么。我引用理查德-费曼（Richard Feynman）的一句话。他说："我无法创造的东西，我也无法理解。"我前几天看到过这句话但现在人们正在创造他们能够创造的东西 但他们并不真正了解其中的奥秘

Is the nature of knowledge changing in a way? Are we going to have to start just taking the word for these models without them being able to explain it to us? The analogy I would offer is to teenagers. If you have a teenager, you know they're human, but you can't quite figure out what they're thinking. But somehow we've managed in society to adapt to the presence of teenagers and they eventually grow out of it.  
知识的本质是否正在发生某种变化？我们是否将不得不开始只相信这些模型的话，而不需要他们向我们解释？我想拿青少年做个比喻。如果你有一个青少年，你知道他们是人类，但你不知道他们在想什么。但不知何故，我们的社会已经适应了青少年的存在，他们最终会成长起来。

I'm just serious. So it's probably the case that we're going to have knowledge systems that we cannot fully characterize, but we understand their boundaries. We understand the limits of what they can do. And that's probably the best outcome we can get. Do you think we'll understand the limits?  
我是认真的。所以，我们可能会有一些知识系统，我们无法完全描述它们的特征，但我们了解它们的边界。我们了解它们所能做的极限。这也许就是我们能得到的最好结果。你认为我们会了解它们的极限吗？

We'll get pretty good at it. The consensus of my group that meets every week is that eventually the way you'll do this so-called adversarial AI is that there will actually be companies that you will hire and pay money to to break your AI system. Like Red Team. So instead of human Red Teams, which is what they do today, you'll have whole companies and a whole industry of AI systems whose jobs are to break the existing AI systems and find their vulnerabilities, especially the knowledge that they have that we can't figure out. That makes sense to me.  
我们会做得很好的。我所在的小组每周都会开会，大家的共识是，最终所谓的对抗式人工智能，其实就是会有一些公司受雇于你，并付钱给他们来破解你的人工智能系统。比如红队。因此，你将拥有整个公司和整个行业的人工智能系统，而不是现在的人类红队，他们的工作就是破解现有的人工智能系统，找到它们的漏洞，尤其是它们拥有的我们无法弄明白的知识。我觉得这很有道理。

It's also a great project for you here at Stanford, because if you have a graduate student who has to figure out how to attack one of these large models and understand what it does, that is a great skill to build the next generation. So it makes sense to me that the two will travel together. All right, let's take some questions from the student. There's one right there in the back. Just say your name.  
对你们斯坦福大学来说，这也是一个很好的项目，因为如果你们有一个研究生要想办法攻克这些大型模型中的一个，并理解它的作用，这对培养下一代是一项很好的技能。因此，在我看来，这两者的结合是合情合理的。好了，我们来听听学生们的问题。后面就有一个。请说出你的名字。

Earlier you mentioned, and this is related to this comment right now, getting AI that actually does what you want. You just mentioned adversarial AI, and I'm wondering if you can elaborate on that more. So it seems to be, besides obviously computer language reasons to get more performant models, but getting them to do what you want to do seems partly unanswered in my view. Well, you have to assume that the current hallucination problems become less as the technology gets better and so forth. I'm not suggesting it goes away.  
你刚才提到，这与现在的评论有关，让人工智能真正做你想做的事。你刚才提到了对抗式人工智能，我想知道你是否能详细说明一下。在我看来，除了明显的计算机语言原因之外，要获得性能更强的模型，但让它们做你想做的事似乎还有部分问题没有解决。你必须假设，随着技术的进步，目前的幻觉问题会越来越少。我并不是说它会消失。

And then you also have to assume that there are tests for efficacy. So there has to be a way of knowing that the things exceeded. So in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor, and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody's music. What you would do if you're a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you'd hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn't matter that you stole all the content.  
然后，你还必须假定会有药效测试。因此，必须有办法知道这些东西是否超出了预期。因此，在我举的 TikTok 竞争对手的例子中，顺便说一句，我并不是说你应该非法窃取每个人的音乐。如果你是硅谷的创业者，希望你们都是，你会做的是，如果它起飞了，你就会雇一大堆律师去收拾残局，对吗？但如果没人使用你的产品，你偷了所有内容也没用。

And do not quote me. Right. Right. You're on camera. Yeah, that's right.  
不要引用我的话。好吧 好吧 Right.Right. - Right.你上镜了是啊，这是正确的。

But you see my point. In other words, Silicon Valley will run these tests and clean up the mess. And that's typically how those things are done. So my own view is that you'll see more and more performative systems with even better tests and eventually adversarial tests, and that will keep it within a box. The technical term is called chain of thought reasoning.  
但你明白我的意思。换句话说，硅谷会进行这些测试，然后收拾残局。这些事情通常就是这么做的。因此，我个人的观点是，你将会看到越来越多的高性能系统，这些系统将进行更好的测试，并最终进行对抗性测试，这将使系统保持在一个框内。专业术语叫做思维链推理。

And people believe that in the next few years, you'll be able to generate a thousand steps of chain of thought reasoning, right? Do this, do this. It's like building recipes, right? That the recipes, you can run the recipe and you can actually test that it produced the correct outcome. And that's how the system will work.  
人们相信，在未来几年内，你就能产生上千步的连锁思维推理，对吗？这样做，这样做。这就像建立食谱，对吧？你可以运行食谱，然后测试它是否产生了正确的结果。这就是系统的工作原理。

Yes, sir? \[inaudible\] In general, you seem super positive about the potential for AI's problems. I'm curious, like, what do you think is going to drive that? Is it just more compute? Is it more data?  
什么事 先生\[总的来说 你似乎对人工智能的潜在问题 非常乐观我很好奇，你认为人工智能的发展前景如何？是更多的计算？还是更多的数据？

Is it fundamental or actual shifts? Yes. Do you agree? The amounts of money being thrown around are mind-boggling. And I've chosen, I essentially invest in everything because I can't figure out who's going to win.  
是根本性转变还是实际转变？是的。你同意吗？现在投的钱多得让人匪夷所思。而我的选择是，我基本上什么都投，因为我不知道谁会赢。

And the amounts of money that are following me are so large. I think some of it is because the early money has been made and the big money people who don't know what they're doing have to have an AI component. And everything is now an AI investment, so they can't tell the difference. I define AI as learning systems, systems that actually learn. So I think that's one of them.  
而追随我的资金数额是如此之大。我认为这其中有一部分原因是早期的钱已经赚到了，而那些不知道自己在做什么的大款们必须要有人工智能的成分。现在什么都是人工智能投资，所以他们分不清楚。我把人工智能定义为学习系统，真正能够学习的系统。所以我认为这是其中之一。

The second is that there are very sophisticated new algorithms that are sort of post-transformers. My friend, my collaborator, for a long time has invented a new non-transformer architecture. There's a group that I'm funding in Paris that has claims to have done the same thing. There's enormous invention there, a lot of things at Stanford. And the final thing is that there is a belief in the market that the invention of intelligence has infinite return.  
其次，有一些非常复杂的新算法，属于后变换器。我的朋友，我的合作者，长期以来发明了一种新的非变换器架构。我在巴黎资助的一个小组也声称做了同样的事情。斯坦福大学有很多发明。最后一点是，市场上有一种信念，即智能发明的回报是无限的。

So let's say you put $50 billion of capital into a company, you have to make an awful lot of money from intelligence to pay that back. So it's probably the case that we'll go through some huge investment bubble, and then it'll sort itself out. That's always been true in the past, and it's likely to be true here. And what you said earlier was you think that the leaders are pulling away from the rest. Right now.  
因此，假设你向一家公司投入了 500 亿美元的资金，你就必须从情报中赚取大量的钱来偿还这笔投资。因此，我们可能会经历一些巨大的投资泡沫，然后它会自行解决。过去如此，现在也可能如此。你刚才说，你认为领头羊正在拉开与其他领头羊的距离。现在

And the question is roughly the following. There's a company called Mistral in France. They've done a really good job. And I'm obviously an investor. They have produced their second version.  
问题大致如下。法国有一家叫 Mistral 的公司。他们做得非常好。很显然，我是他们的投资者。他们已经推出了第二个版本。

Their third model is likely to be closed because it's so expensive, they need revenue, and they can't give their model away. So this open source versus closed source debate in our industry is huge. And my entire career was based on people being willing to share software in open source. Everything about me is open source. Much of Google's underpinnings were open source.  
他们的第三种模式很可能是封闭的，因为它非常昂贵，他们需要收入，而且他们不能把自己的模式拱手相让。因此，在我们这个行业，开源与闭源的争论是巨大的。我的整个职业生涯都建立在人们愿意分享开源软件的基础上。我的一切都是开源的。谷歌的许多基础都是开源的。

Everything I've done technically. And yet, it may be that the capital costs, which are so immense, fundamentally changes how software is built. You and I were talking. My own view of software programmers is that software programmers' productivity will at least double. There are three or four software companies that are trying to do that.  
我在技术上所做的一切。然而，资本成本如此巨大，可能会从根本上改变软件的构建方式。你和我在聊天。我对软件程序员的看法是，软件程序员的生产力至少会翻一番。有三四家软件公司正在尝试这样做。

I've invested in all of them in the spirit. And they're all trying to make software programmers more productive. The most interesting one that I just met with is called Augment. And I always think of an individual programmer. And they said, that's not our target.  
我对它们都进行了精神投资。它们都在努力提高软件程序员的工作效率。我刚见过的最有趣的一家叫做 Augment。我总是想到单个的程序员。他们说，那不是我们的目标。

Our target are these 100 person software programming teams on millions of lines of code where nobody knows what's going on. Well, that's a really good AI thing. Will they make money? I hope so. So a lot of questions here.  
我们的目标是由 100 人组成的软件编程团队，他们要编写数百万行代码，但没人知道发生了什么。好吧，这真是人工智能的好东西。他们能赚钱吗？但愿如此。这里有很多问题。

Hi. So at the very beginning you mentioned that there's the combination of the context window expansion. The agents and the text to action is going to have unimaginable impacts. First of all, why is the combination important? And second of all, I know that you're not like a crystal ball and you can't necessarily tell the future.  
您在一开始就提到了上下文窗口的扩展。代理和文本到行动将产生难以想象的影响。首先，为什么这种组合很重要？其次，我知道你不像水晶球，不一定能预知未来。

But why do you think it's beyond anything that we could imagine? I think largely because the context window allows you to solve the problem of recency. The current models take a year to train roughly 18 months, six months of preparation, six months of training, six months of fine tuning. So they're always out of date. Context window, you can feed what happened.  
但为什么说它超出了我们的想象呢？我认为主要是因为情境窗口可以解决重复性问题。目前的模型需要一年的时间来训练，大概需要 18 个月，六个月的准备，六个月的训练，六个月的微调。所以它们总是过时的。而 "上下文窗口 "则可以提供所发生的事情。

You can ask it questions about the Hamas Israel war in a context. That's very powerful. It becomes current like Google. In the case of agents, I'll give you an example. I set up a foundation which is funding a nonprofit.  
你可以向它提出有关哈马斯以色列战争的问题。这非常强大。它就像谷歌一样，变得与时俱进。就代理商而言，我给你举个例子。我成立了一个基金会，为一家非营利组织提供资金。

I don't know if there's chemists in the room. I don't really understand chemistry. There's a tool called ChemCrow, C-R-O-W, which was an LLM-based system that learned chemistry. And what they do is they run it to generate chemistry hypotheses about proteins and they have a lab which runs the tests overnight and then it learns. That's a huge acceleration, accelerant in chemistry, material science and so forth.  
我不知道房间里有没有化学家。我不太懂化学。有一种工具叫 "ChemCrow"，C-R-O-W，是一种基于LLM的学习化学的系统。他们所做的就是运行它来生成关于蛋白质的化学假设，然后他们有一个实验室，通宵进行测试，然后它就会学习。这在化学、材料科学等领域是一个巨大的加速器。

So that's an agent model. And I think the text to action can be understood by just having a lot of cheap programmers, right? And I don't think we understand what happens, and this is again your area of expertise, what happens when everyone has their own programmer. And I'm not talking about turning on and off the lights. I imagine, another example, for some reason you don't like Google.  
这就是一种代理模式。我认为，只要有很多廉价的程序员，就能理解从文本到行动的过程，对吗？我不认为我们了解会发生什么，这也是你的专业领域，当每个人都有自己的程序员时会发生什么。我说的不是开灯和关灯。我想，再举一个例子，出于某种原因，你不喜欢谷歌。

So you say, "Build me a Google competitor." Yeah, you personally, you don't build me a Google competitor. "Search the web. Build a UI. Make a good copy. Add generative AI in an interesting way.  
所以你说，"给我打造一个谷歌的竞争对手"。是的，你个人，你不会给我打造一个谷歌的竞争对手。"搜索网络。建立用户界面。做一个好的文案。以有趣的方式添加生成式人工智能。

Do it in 30 seconds and see if it works." Right? So a lot of people believe that the incumbents, including Google, are vulnerable to this kind of an attack. Now, we'll see. There were a bunch of questions who were sent over by Slatter. I want to get some of them were upvoted.  
在 30 秒内完成，看看是否有效"。对吧？所以很多人认为，包括谷歌在内的现有公司 在这种攻击面前不堪一击。现在，我们拭目以待。斯拉特发来了一堆问题我想让他们中的一些人投票。

So here's one. We talked a little bit of this last year. How can we stop AI from influencing public opinion, misinformation, especially during the upcoming election? What are the short and long-term solutions for them? Most of the misinformation in this upcoming election and globally will be on social media.  
这里有一个。我们去年讨论过这个问题。我们如何才能阻止人工智能影响舆论、误导信息，尤其是在即将到来的大选期间？它们的短期和长期解决方案是什么？在即将到来的大选和全球范围内，大部分错误信息都会出现在社交媒体上。

And the social media companies are not organized well enough to police it. If you look at TikTok, for example, there are lots of accusations that TikTok is favoring one kind of misinformation over another. And there are many people who claim without proof, that I'm aware of, that the Chinese are forcing them to do it. I think we have a mess here. And the country's going to have to learn critical thinking.  
而社交媒体公司组织不够完善，无法对其进行监管。以 TikTok 为例，有很多人指责 TikTok 偏爱某种错误信息。据我所知，有很多人在没有证据的情况下声称中国人在强迫他们这样做。我认为我们这里一团糟。这个国家必须学会批判性思维。

That may be an impossible challenge for the U.S. But the fact that somebody told you something does not mean that it's true. Could it go too far the other way? That there's things that really are true and nobody believes anymore. You get some people call it a "pestimological crisis" that now, you know, Elon says, "No, I never did that.  
对美国来说，这可能是一个不可能完成的挑战。但是，有人告诉你的事实并不意味着这是真的。会不会走得太远？有些事情确实是真的，但没人相信了。有人称这是一场 "瘟疫危机"，现在，埃隆说，"不，我从来没做过。

Prove it." Oh, let's use Donald Trump. Look, I think we have a trust problem in our society. Democracies can fail. And I think that the greatest threat to democracy is misinformation because we're going to get really good at it. When I managed YouTube, the biggest problems we had on YouTube were that people would upload false videos and people would die as a result.  
证明给我看"。那就用唐纳德-特朗普吧听着，我认为我们的社会存在信任问题。民主会失败我认为对民主最大的威胁是错误信息 因为我们将变得非常擅长于此。当我管理YouTube时，我们在YouTube上遇到的最大问题就是人们会上传虚假视频，结果导致人们死亡。

And we had a no-death policy. Shocking. And it was just horrendous to try to address this. And this is before generative A.I. I don't have a good answer.  
而且我们有不死政策。令人震惊要解决这个问题简直太可怕了这是在人工智能产生之前 我没有好的答案

One technical is not an answer, but one thing that seems like it could mitigate that I understand why it's more widely used is public key authentication. That when Joe Biden speaks, why isn't it digitally signed like SSL is? Or that celebrities or public figures or others, couldn't they have a public key? Yeah, it's a form of public key and then some form of certainty of knowing how the system When I send my credit card to Amazon, I know it's Amazon. I wrote a paper and published it with Jonathan Haidt, who's the one working on the anxiety generation stuff.  
一项技术并不能解决问题，但有一点似乎可以缓解问题，那就是公钥验证，我明白为什么公钥验证会被更广泛地使用。当乔-拜登发言时，为什么不像 SSL 那样进行数字签名？或者说，名人、公众人物或其他人，就不能有一个公钥吗？是的，这是一种公钥形式，然后是某种形式的确定性，知道系统是如何运行的，当我向亚马逊发送信用卡时，我知道是亚马逊。我和乔纳森-海特一起写了篇论文发表了 他就是研究焦虑产生的人

It had exactly zero impact. And he's a very good communicator. I probably am not. So my conclusion was that the system is not organized to do what you said. You had a paper advocating what we did?  
影响完全为零。他是个很好的沟通者。我可能不是。所以我的结论是，这个系统并没有像你说的那样组织起来。你有一篇论文主张我们的做法？

Advocating your proposal. Okay, my proposal. No, what you said. Yeah, right. And my conclusion is the CEOs in general are maximizing revenue.  
宣传你的建议好吧，我的提议不，是你说的没错我的结论是 CEO们一般都在追求收入最大化

To maximize revenue, you maximize engagement. To maximize engagement, you maximize outrage. The algorithms choose outrage because that generates more revenue. Therefore, there's a bias to favor crazy stuff. And on all sides, I'm not making a partisan statement here.  
为了最大限度地增加收入，就必须最大限度地提高参与度。要使参与度最大化，就要使愤怒最大化。算法选择 "愤怒 "是因为它能带来更多收入。因此，人们会偏向于疯狂的东西。在这里，我并不是在发表党派言论。

That's a problem. That's got to get addressed in a democracy. And my solution to TikTok, we talked about this earlier privately, is there was when I was a boy, there was something called the equal time rule, because TikTok is really not social media. It's really television, right? There's a programmer making you the numbers by the way are 90 minutes a day, 200 TikTok videos per TikTok user in the United States.  
这是一个问题。在民主社会，这个问题必须得到解决。我对 TikTok 的解决方案是，我们之前私下讨论过这个问题，在我还是个孩子的时候，有一个叫做 "平等时间规则 "的东西，因为 TikTok 真的不是社交媒体。因为 TikTok 真的不是社交媒体，而是电视，对吧？顺便说一下，有个程序员给你算的数据是，在美国，每个 TikTok 用户每天可以观看 90 分钟、200 个 TikTok 视频。

It's a lot, right? So and the government is not going to do the equal time rule, but it's the right thing to do. Some form of balance that is required. All right, let's take some more questions. Two quick questions.  
很多，对吧？所以，政府不会实行平等时间规则，但这是应该做的。需要某种形式的平衡。好了，我们再来问几个问题。两个简单的问题

One, economic impact of LMs. Slower, like, market impacts. Slower. You originally anticipated CHEG and a couple of service people. And then two, do you think academia deserves or should get AI subsidies?  
一是 LM 的经济影响。二，市场影响。比较慢。你最初预计的是 CHEG 和几个服务人员。第二，你认为学术界值得或应该获得人工智能补贴吗？

Or do you think they should just partner with big players out there? I pushed really, really hard on getting data centers for universities. If I were a faculty member in the computer science department here, I would be beyond upset that I can't build the algorithms with my graduate students that will do the kind of PhD research. And I'm forced to work with these. And the companies have not, in my view, been generous enough with respect to that.  
还是说，你认为他们应该与外面的大公司合作？我非常非常努力地为大学争取数据中心。如果我是这里计算机科学系的一名教员，我一定会为无法与我的研究生一起构建算法而感到非常沮丧，因为他们无法完成博士研究课题。而我却不得不与这些公司合作。在我看来，公司在这方面还不够慷慨。

The faculty members that I talk with, many of whom you know, spend lots of time waiting for their credits from Google Cloud. That's terrible. This is an explosion we want America to win. We want American universities. There's lots of reasons to think that the right thing to do is to get it to them.  
与我交谈过的教职员工，其中很多人你都认识，他们花了很多时间等待谷歌云的学分。这太可怕了。我们希望美国赢得这场爆炸。我们想要美国的大学。我们有很多理由认为，正确的做法是把它交给他们。

So I'm working hard on that. And your first question was labor market impact. I'll defer to the real expert here. As your amateur economist taught by Eric, I fundamentally believe that the college education high skills task will be fine because people will work with these systems. I think the systems is no different from any other technology wave.  
所以我正在努力解决这个问题。你的第一个问题是劳动力市场的影响。我想请教真正的专家。作为埃里克教授的业余经济学家，我从根本上相信，大学教育的高技能任务会很好，因为人们会使用这些系统工作。我认为这些系统与其他技术浪潮并无不同。

The dangerous jobs and the jobs which require very little human judgment will get replaced. We've got about five minutes left. So let's go really quick with some quick. I'll let you pick them, Eric. Yes, ma'am.  
危险的工作和不需要人做判断的工作将被取代。我们还剩五分钟。让我们来快速讨论一下吧你来选吧，埃里克好的，女士

Hi. I'm really curious about the text to action and its impact on, for example, computer science education. I'm wondering what you have thoughts on how CS education should transform to meet the age. Well, I'm assuming that computer scientists as a group in undergraduate school will always have a programmer buddy with them. So when you learn your first for loop and so forth and so on, you'll have a tool that will be your natural partner.  
你好，我对 "从文本到行动 "及其对计算机科学教育的影响非常好奇。我想知道你对计算机科学教育应如何转型以适应时代有何想法。我认为，计算机科学家作为一个群体，在本科阶段总会有一个程序员伙伴与他们在一起。因此，当你学习第一个 for 循环，等等等等，你会有一个工具成为你的天然伙伴。

And that's how the teaching will go on. That the professor, he or she will talk about the concepts, but you'll engage with it that way. And that's my guess. Yes, ma'am, behind you. Yeah.  
教学就是这样进行的。教授会讲述概念，但你会以这种方式参与其中。这是我的猜测是的，女士，在你后面好的

You're talking more about the non-transformer architectures that you're excited about. I think one that's been talked about is like state models, but then now a longer context class. I'm more so curious what you're seeing in this case. I don't understand the math well enough. I'm really pleased that we have produced jobs for mathematicians because the math here is so complicated, but basically they are different ways of doing gradient descent, matrix multiply, faster and better.  
你说的更多的是你感兴趣的非转换器架构。我认为其中一个已经被讨论过的架构就像状态模型，但现在是一个更长的上下文类。我更好奇的是你在这种情况下看到了什么。我不太懂数学。我很高兴我们为数学家提供了工作机会，因为这里的数学太复杂了，但基本上它们是梯度下降、矩阵乘法的不同方法，更快、更好。

And transformers, as you know, is a sort of systematic way of multiplying at the same time. That's the way I think about it. And it's similar to that, but different math. Let's see, over here. Yes, sir.  
而变压器，正如你所知道的，是一种系统的同时乘法。我就是这么想的。和那个差不多，但数学不同。让我们看看，在这里。好的 先生

Go ahead. You mentioned in your paper on natural security that you have China and the U.S. and the help of modern architectures today. The next 10 and the next cluster down are all other U.S. allies or teed up nicely through the U.S.  
请讲。你在关于自然安全的论文中提到了中国和美国以及当今现代架构的帮助。接下来的 10 个国家和下一个国家集群都是美国的盟友，或者通过美国很好地撮合了这些国家。

allies. I'm curious what your take is on those 10 and the middle that aren't formally allies. How likely are they to get on board with securing our security deadline and what would hold them back from wanting to get on board? The most interesting country is India because the top AI people come from India to the U.S. and we should let India keep some of its top talent.  
盟友。我很好奇，你对这 10 个国家和中间的非正式盟国有何看法？他们有多大可能加入到确保我们安全的大限中来，是什么阻碍了他们加入？最有趣的国家是印度，因为顶尖的人工智能人才都是从印度来到美国的，我们应该让印度留住一些顶尖人才。

Not all of them, but some of them. And they don't have the kind of training facilities and programs that we so richly have here. To me, India is the big swing state in that regard. China's lost. It's not going to come back.  
不是全部，但也有一些。而且他们也没有我们这里丰富的培训设施和项目。在我看来，印度是这方面最大的摇摆国。中国已经输了。它不会再回来了。

They're not going to change the regime as much as people wish them to do. Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp. Taiwan is a fantastic country whose software is terrible, so that's not going to work. Amazing hardware. And in the rest of the world, there are not a lot of other good choices that are big.  
他们不会像人们希望的那样改变政权。日本和韩国显然是我们的阵营。台湾是一个神奇的国家，但软件却很糟糕，所以这行不通。硬件令人惊叹。而在世界其他地方，也没有什么大的好选择。

Europe is screwed up because of Brussels. It's not a new fact. I spent 10 years fighting them. And I worked really hard to get them to fix the EU act and they still have all the restrictions that make it very difficult to do our kind of research in Europe. My French friends have spent all their time battling Brussels and Macron, who's a personal friend, is fighting hard for this.  
欧洲因为布鲁塞尔而变得一团糟。这不是新事实。我花了 10 年时间与他们斗争。我花了 10 年时间与他们斗争，我非常努力地让他们修改欧盟法案，但他们仍然有各种限制，使我们在欧洲开展研究变得非常困难。我的法国朋友花了很多时间与布鲁塞尔斗争，马克龙，他是我的私人朋友，正在为此而努力奋斗。

And so France, I think, has a chance. I don't see Germany coming and the rest is not big enough. Go ahead. Yes, ma'am. So I learned you're an engineer by training, like you call the compiler.  
因此，我认为法国还有机会。我觉得德国不会来，其他国家也不够大。说吧好的，夫人我知道你是工程师出身 就像你说的编译器一样

Given the capabilities that you envision these models having, should we still spend time learning to code? Because ultimately, it's the old thing of why do you study English if you can speak English? You get better at it. You really do need to understand how these systems work, and I feel very strongly. Yes, sir.  
鉴于你所设想的这些模型所具备的能力，我们还应该花时间学习编码吗？因为归根结底，这还是一个老问题：如果你会说英语，为什么还要学英语？你会说得更好。你确实需要了解这些系统是如何工作的，我对此深有感触。是的，先生。

Yeah. I'm curious if you've explored the distributed setting and I'm asking because, sure, like making a large cluster is difficult, but MacBooks are powerful. There's a lot of small machines across the world. So do you think like folding at home or a similar idea works for training? It does not.  
我很好奇你们是否探索过分布式设置，我这么问是因为，当然，像创建一个大型集群是很困难的，但 MacBook 功能强大。全世界有很多小型机器。那么，你认为在家折叠或类似的想法适用于培训吗？不适用。

Yeah, we've looked very hard at this. So the way the algorithms work is you have a very large matrix and you have essentially a multiplication function. So think of it as going back and forth and back and forth. And these systems are completely limited by the speed of memory to CPU or GPU. And in fact, the next iteration of Nvidia chips has combined all those functions into one chip.  
是的，我们对此进行了深入研究。算法的工作原理是，你有一个非常大的矩阵，本质上是一个乘法函数。所以，你可以把它想象成来来回回的运算。这些系统完全受限于 CPU 或 GPU 的内存速度。事实上，下一代 Nvidia 芯片已经将所有这些功能整合到了一个芯片中。

The chips are now so big that they glue them all together. And in fact, the package is so sensitive that the package is put together in a clean room as well as the chip itself. So the answer looks like supercomputers and speed of light, especially memory interconnect, really dominate it. So I think unlikely for a while. Is there a way to segment the LLM?  
现在的芯片非常大，所以要把它们粘在一起。事实上，封装是如此敏感，以至于封装和芯片本身都是在无尘室中组装的。因此，答案看起来就像超级计算机和光速，尤其是内存互联，真的占据了主导地位。因此，我认为暂时不太可能。有办法分割 LLM 吗？

So Jeff Dean, last year when he spoke here, talked about having these different parts of it that you would train separately and then kind of federate. In order to do that, you'd have to have 10 million such things and then the way you would ask the questions would be too slow. He's talking about eight or 10 or 12 supercomputers. Yeah, yeah. So not at the level of MacBooks.  
因此，杰夫-迪恩去年在这里发言时，谈到了让这些不同的部分分别进行培训，然后再进行某种联合。要做到这一点，你必须拥有 1000 万台这样的机器，而你提出问题的速度又太慢。他说的是8台、10台或12台超级计算机是啊，是啊所以还没达到MacBook的水平

Not at his level. Yeah. Let's see, in the back. Yes, way back. So I know after GQQ was released in the New York Times to open it up for using their works for training, where do you think that's going to go and what that means for data processing?  
不是他的水平是啊我看看，在后面是的，在后面我知道《GQQ》在《纽约时报》上发表后，开放了他们的作品用于培训，你认为这将走向何方，对数据处理意味着什么？

I used to do a lot of work on the music licensing stuff. What I learned was that in the 60s, there was a series of lawsuits that resulted in an agreement where you get a stipulated royalty whenever your song is played. Even they don't even know who you are. It's just paid into a bank. And my guess is it'll be the same thing.  
我曾经做过很多音乐许可方面的工作。我了解到，在上世纪 60 年代，有一系列的诉讼，最终达成了一项协议，只要你的歌曲被播放，你就可以获得规定的使用费。甚至他们都不知道你是谁。只是把钱存进银行我猜也会是同样的结果

There'll be lots of lawsuits and there'll be some kind of stipulated agreement, which will just say you have to pay X percent of whatever revenue you have in order to use ASCAP BMI. ASCAP BMI. Look them up. It's along. It will seem very old to you, but I think that's how it will alternate.  
会有很多诉讼，也会有某种规定性协议，上面会写明，为了使用 ASCAP BMI，你必须支付收入的 X%。ASCAP BMI查查他们一直沿用至今你会觉得这很老套 但我认为这就是未来的趋势

Yes, sir. Yeah, it seems like there's a few players that are dominating AI, right? And they'll continue to dominate. And they seem to overlap with the large companies that all the antitrust regulation is kind of focused on. How do you see those two trends kind of...  
是的，先生似乎有几个玩家在主宰人工智能，对吧？而且他们会继续占据主导地位。而且他们似乎与所有反垄断法都关注的大公司重叠。你如何看待这两种趋势？

Yeah, do you see regulators breaking up these companies and how will that affect the... Yeah. So in my career, I helped Microsoft get broken up and it wasn't broken up. And I fought for Google to not be broken up and it's not been broken up. So it sure looks to me like the trend is not to be broken up.  
是的，你认为监管机构会拆散这些公司吗？会有什么影响在我的职业生涯中，我帮助微软被拆分，但它没有被拆分。我为谷歌争取不被拆分，它也没有被拆分。所以在我看来，不被拆分是大势所趋。

As long as the companies avoid being John D. Rockefeller the senior. And I studied this. Look it up. That's how antitrust law came.  
只要公司避免成为约翰-洛克菲勒的前辈。我研究过这个。查一下反垄断法就是这么来的

I don't think the governments will act... The reason you're seeing these large companies dominate is who has the capital to build these data centers, right? So my friend Reed and my friend Mustapha... He's coming next week, two weeks from now. Have Reed talk to you about the decision that they made to take inflection and essentially piece part it into Microsoft.  
我认为政府不会采取行动...你看到这些大公司占据主导地位的原因 是谁有资本来建造这些数据中心，对吗？所以我的朋友里德和我的朋友穆斯塔法...他下周就来，两周后让里德跟你谈谈他们做出的决定，即把拐点公司并入微软。

Basically, they decided they couldn't raise the tens of billions of dollars. Is that number public that you mentioned earlier? No. Have Reed give you the number. Maybe Reed can say it.  
基本上，他们决定无法筹集到数百亿美元。你刚才提到的数字公开了吗？没有，让里德告诉你吧也许里德能说出来

I know you got to go. I don't want to hold you back. I want to leave with... Shall we do one? This gentleman.  
我知道你得走了我不想拖累你我想和......我们来一个？这位先生

I also have a question for you. One more. Yeah, go ahead. Thank you so much. I was wondering where all of this is going to lead countries who are non-participants in development of frontier models and access to compute, for example.  
我也有一个问题要问你。还有一个好，问吧非常感谢。我想知道，这一切将把那些没有参与前沿模型开发和获得计算能力的国家引向何方。

The rich get richer and the poor do the best they can. They'll have to... The fact of the matter is this is a rich country's game, right? Huge capital, lots of technically strong people, strong government support, right? There are two examples.  
富人更富，穷人尽力而为。他们不得不...事实上，这是富国的游戏，对吧？资本雄厚，技术人才济济，政府支持有力，对吧？有两个例子

There are lots of other countries that have all sorts of problems. They don't have those resources. They'll have to find a partner. They'll have to join with somebody else, something like that. I want to leave it...  
还有很多其他国家存在各种各样的问题。他们没有这些资源。他们必须找到一个合作伙伴。他们必须和别人联合起来，诸如此类。我想让它...

Because I think the last time we met you, you were at a hackathon at AGI House and I know you spend a lot of time helping young people as they create a lot of wealth, and you spoke very passionately about wanting to do that. Do you have any advice for folks here as they're building their... They're writing their business plans for this class or policy proposals or research proposals at this stage of the careers going forward? Well, I teach a class in the business school on this, so you should come to my class. I am struck by the speed with which you can build demonstrations of new ideas.  
我知道你花了很多时间帮助年轻人创造财富，你也非常热情地谈到了你的愿望。你对在座的各位有什么建议吗？他们在为这门课撰写商业计划书或政策建议书或研究建议书时，有什么建议吗？我在商学院教过这方面的课程，所以你们应该来听我的课。我很震惊于你能以如此快的速度建立新想法的示范。

So, in one of the hackathons I did, the winning team, the command was, "Fly the drone between two towers," and it was given a virtual drone space. And it figured out how to fly the drone, what the word between meant, generated the code in Python, and flew the drone in the simulator through the tower. It would have taken a week or two from good professional programmers to do that. I'm telling you that the ability to prototype quickly... Part of the problem with being an entrepreneur is everything happens faster.  
因此，在我参加的一次黑客马拉松中，获胜团队的指令是 "让无人机在两座塔之间飞行"，并给了他们一个虚拟的无人机空间。它想出了如何驾驶无人机，"两塔之间 "是什么意思，用 Python 生成了代码，并在模拟器中驾驶无人机穿过了高塔。如果是优秀的专业程序员，要花一两个星期才能做到这一点。我告诉你，快速开发原型的能力......创业者的部分问题在于一切都发生得更快。

Well, now, if you can't get your prototype built in a day using these various tools, you need to think about that, right? Because that's who your competitor is doing. So, I guess my biggest advice is when you start thinking about a company, it's fine to write a business plan. In fact, you should ask the computer to write your business plan for you, as long as it's legal. No, no.  
好了，现在，如果你不能使用这些不同的工具在一天内制作出你的原型，你就需要考虑一下了，对吗？因为你的竞争对手就是这样做的。所以，我想我最大的建议是，当你开始考虑成立一家公司时，写一份商业计划书就可以了。事实上，只要合法，你应该让电脑帮你写商业计划书。不，不

Actually, I should talk about that after you leave this. But I think it's very important to prototype your idea using these tools as quickly as you can, because you can be sure there's another person doing exactly that same thing in another company, in another university, in a place that you've never been. All right. Well, thanks very much, Aaron. Thank you all.  
实际上，我应该在你离开之后再谈这个问题。但我认为，使用这些工具尽快将你的想法原型化是非常重要的，因为你可以肯定，在另一家公司、在另一所大学、在一个你从未去过的地方，还有另一个人在做着一模一样的事情。好的非常感谢，亚伦。谢谢大家。

I'm going to rush off. Thank you. So, actually, let me pick up on that very last point, because I don't think I talked about in the first class about using LLMs, which is welcome in this class for the assignments, but it has to get to your full disclosure. So, when you use them, whether it's for the weekly assignments or for the final project or whatever, just like you would if you asked your friendly uncle or a classmate or anybody else to give you advice, you should do that, or if you have notes that you include in there. So, what I thought I'd do is I want to talk a little bit about AIs as a GPT and what that means in terms of business and implications.  
我得走了谢谢。实际上，让我来谈谈最后一点，因为我想我在第一节课上没有提到过使用 LLMs 的问题，这节课欢迎大家在作业中使用LLMs，但必须完全公开。因此，当你使用它们时，无论是每周的作业还是最后的项目或其他，就像你请你友好的叔叔、同学或其他人给你建议一样，你应该这样做，或者如果你有笔记，你也可以把它包括进去。所以，我想做的是，我想谈谈人工智能作为一种 GPT，以及它在商业方面的意义和影响。

But before we do that, I just want to see if there are any questions you want to pick up on things that Eric brought up that I'll try and channel some of his thoughts, and we can talk about the things that came up, and then we can move on. Yeah, go ahead. One of the questions I want to ask is in relation to regulation, if the goal is to maintain supremacy, how do you create the right incentives so that everyone, allies and non-allies, are motivated to follow it? You mean among companies that are competing with each other? Companies are in countries, the U.S.  
但在此之前，我想看看你们是否有任何问题，想就埃里克提出的问题进行提问，我将尝试引导他的一些想法，我们可以就提出的问题进行讨论，然后我们就可以继续了。好的，继续。我想问的一个问题是，在监管方面，如果目标是保持霸主地位，那么如何建立正确的激励机制，让所有人，包括盟友和非盟友，都有动力去遵守？你是指相互竞争的公司吗？公司在各国都有，美国就有。

and the EU, and it doesn't just become sort of a hamper or obstruct kind of development for the ones that choose to follow the regulations? It's super tricky. There's a book, Co-Opetition, that Mary Nailbough wrote about this, because there are definitely places where regulation can help companies and help an industry survive. So regulation doesn't necessarily slow things. I mean, standards are a good example, and having that clarified can make it easier for companies to compete.  
和欧盟，它不会成为选择遵守法规的国家发展的阻碍或障碍吗？这非常棘手。玛丽-奈尔博夫（Mary Nailbough）写过一本书《竞争》（Co-Opetition），书中提到了这一点，因为在某些地方，监管肯定能帮助公司和行业生存。所以，监管不一定会拖慢发展。我的意思是，标准就是一个很好的例子，明确标准可以让公司更容易参与竞争。

So I've talked to a lot of the executives of these companies, and there are places where they wish there were some common standards, and sometimes there's a bit of a race to the bottom as well on some of the dangerous things. One of the other reasons that the folks at Google say that they didn't move as fast is they felt like these LMs could be misused or dangerous, but their hand was sort of forced. I was talking to some folks at one of the other big companies, and they said, "We weren't going to release this feature, but now competitors are doing it, so we're going to have to release it as well." So this is where regulation, there might be some interest in coordinating on regulation, but it's also, obviously, the more obvious thing is that it is used to hinder competition, and a lot of people, for instance, think that the reasons that some of the big companies are very opposed to some of the open source and making things more widely open source is they want to slow down competitors. So there's both of those things going on. Yeah.  
因此，我和这些公司的很多高管都聊过，在有些地方，他们希望能有一些共同的标准，有时，在一些危险的事情上，他们也会竞相效仿。谷歌的人说，他们没有那么快行动的另一个原因是，他们觉得这些 LMs 可能会被滥用或造成危险，但他们的行动是被迫的。我和其他一些大公司的人聊过，他们说："我们本来不打算发布这个功能，但现在竞争对手都在做，所以我们也必须发布。"所以，这就是监管，在协调监管方面可能会有一些利益，但它也是，很明显，更明显的事情是，它被用来阻碍竞争，例如，很多人认为，一些大公司非常反对一些开放源代码和更广泛地开放源代码的原因是，他们希望减缓竞争对手的步伐。所以，这两件事都有可能发生。是啊。

Quick question over there. I just want to follow up on a comment about, should we still learn to code? Should we still study English? Are those going to be useful? And Eric's replied, yes, like college-educated, high-skilled jobs or tasks are still going to be safe, but everything else that's going to require image editing might not be.  
那边有一个快速问题。我只是想跟进一个评论，关于我们还应该学习代码吗？我们还应该学习英语吗？这些有用吗？埃里克回答说，是的，像受过大学教育的高技能工作或任务仍然是安全的，但其他所有需要图像编辑的工作可能就不安全了。

That's kind of like an interesting one. Maybe we'll talk some more about that in a few minutes, but it is interesting to think about where the AI systems just replace what people are doing versus they complement them. And in coding right now, it appears that they're not actually that helpful for the really best coders. They're very helpful for moderately good coders. But if you don't know anything at all about coding, they're not helpful either.  
这是一个有趣的问题。也许我们几分钟后会再讨论这个问题，但思考一下人工智能系统在哪些方面取代了人们正在做的事情，而不是对他们进行补充，还是很有意思的。目前在编码方面，人工智能系统似乎对真正优秀的编码员帮助不大。它们对中等水平的编码员很有帮助。但如果你对编码一窍不通，它们也帮不上忙。

So it's kind of an inverted you. And you can see why that would be the case, that if you don't even understand the code that they generate right now is often buggy or it isn't exactly right. So if you can't even interpret and understand what's going on, you can't use it very effectively. And for now, the very best coders, it appears that the code that is generated isn't at that level, so you get that U shape. But that means if you don't know any code, you do need to have some in order for it to be useful.  
所以，这就像是一个倒置的你。你可以理解为什么会出现这种情况，因为如果你甚至不理解他们现在生成的代码，这些代码往往会有漏洞，或者并不完全正确。因此，如果你甚至不能解释和理解发生了什么，你就不能非常有效地使用它。就目前而言，最优秀的编码员生成的代码似乎还没有达到这个水平，所以你会看到 U 形。但这意味着，如果你不知道任何代码，你确实需要掌握一些代码，这样才能让它发挥作用。

And I think that's true for a lot of applications right now, that you have to have some basic understanding in order to get the most of it. I think it's an interesting open question if that's always going to be the case. I put up at the last class very briefly this slide that had level 0 through 5 autonomous cars. And one of the things that actually we can talk about now is I'm trying to sort through is what if you took that paradigm and you applied it to all tasks in the economy? Like how many would they go through?  
我认为现在很多应用都是如此，你必须有一些基本的了解才能充分利用它。我想这是一个有趣的悬而未决的问题，是否会一直如此。我在上一堂课上非常简短地展示了这张幻灯片，上面有 0 到 5 级的自动驾驶汽车。实际上，我们现在可以讨论的一件事是，我试图理清的是，如果你把这个范式应用到经济中的所有任务中会怎样？比如他们会经历多少次？

So with autonomous cars, we aren't really at level 5 very much although I don't know how many of you guys have ridden in a Waymo, one of the Waymo cars. So that one seems pretty good, although Sebastian Thrun, who I rode in it with, says it's just incredibly expensive right now. They probably lose $50 to $100. He doesn't know he's not there. He started the program, but he's not there anymore.  
虽然我不知道你们当中有多少人坐过 Waymo（Waymo 汽车之一），但我们的自动驾驶汽车还没有达到第五级。虽然和我一起坐过的塞巴斯蒂安-特伦（Sebastian Thrun）说，现在这辆车的价格高得惊人，但看起来还是不错的。他们可能会损失 50 到 100 美元。他不知道自己不在那里。他启动了这个项目，但现在已经不在了。

But just all of the costs of running it, it's not practical. Maybe it'll get down the curve. Lidar will get cheaper, but we have a lot of sort of autonomous cars at level 2, 3, even 4, arguably, where humans are still involved. And you see a lot of other tasks like coding. I just talked about that.  
但由于运行成本太高，这并不现实。也许它会逐渐下降。激光雷达的成本会越来越低，但我们有很多自动驾驶汽车还处于2、3甚至4级水平，可以说，人类仍然参与其中。你还会看到很多其他任务，比如编码。我刚刚谈到了这一点。

On the other hand, chess, that slide, the slide before it, I talked about what's sometimes called advanced chess or freestyle chess. When Gary Kasparov, after he lost to Deep Blue in 1998, '97, he started this set of competitions where humans and machines could work together. And for a long time, when I gave my TED talk, it was true, my TED talk in 2012, 2013, it was true at that time that a human working with a machine could beat Deep Blue or any chess computer. And so the very best chess playing entities were these combinations. That's not true anymore.  
另一方面，国际象棋，那张幻灯片，在它之前的那张幻灯片，我谈到了有时被称为高级国际象棋或自由式国际象棋的东西。加里-卡斯帕罗夫（Gary Kasparov）在1998、97年输给 "深蓝"（Deep Blue）后，开始举办一系列人机合作的比赛。在很长一段时间里，当我在TED演讲时，我在2012年、2013年的TED演讲中说，人类与机器合作可以击败 "深蓝 "或任何国际象棋计算机。因此，最好的下棋实体就是这些组合。现在已经不是这样了。

AlphaZero and other programs like that, they would get nothing from a human contributing, just be like kind of an annoyance to the chess machine. So that went through level zero, machines not being able to do anything, through a period where they work together to a period where it's fully autonomous in a span of 20 years or so. It would be interesting if anybody wants to work on a research project or if any of you guys have thoughts right now, what are the criteria for which kinds of tasks in the economy will be in that middle zone? Because that middle zone is kind of a nice one for us humans where the machines are helping us, but humans are still indispensable to creating value and that would be, that's a zone where you can have higher productivity, more wealth and performance, but also more likely to have shared prosperity because labor is sort of inherently distributed, whereas technology and capital, as Eric was just saying, potentially could be very concentrated. Do you have a thought on that?  
阿尔法零和其他类似的程序，它们不会从人类的贡献中得到任何东西，只是象棋机器的一种烦恼。因此，在 20 年左右的时间里，机器经历了从什么都做不了的 "零级"，到共同工作的阶段，再到完全自主的阶段。如果有人想做一个研究项目，或者你们现在有什么想法，那就很有意思了，经济中的哪些任务会处于中间地带，标准是什么？因为对于我们人类来说，中间地带是一个很好的地带，机器可以帮助我们，但人类仍然是创造价值不可或缺的因素，在这个地带，你可以获得更高的生产率、更多的财富和业绩，同时也更有可能实现共同繁荣，因为劳动力本质上是分布式的，而技术和资本，正如埃里克刚才所说，可能会非常集中。你对此有什么看法吗？

I was just going to ask kind of a related question. He was saying also that we have a 10 year like chip manufacturing. Yeah, I was surprised about that. And I think what was interesting to me as a labor economist is that it was really like a green flag I've seen in literature and news that, okay, if we're on showing all of this chip manufacturing, isn't that going to create some sort of resurgence in blue collar jobs? And I wondered if you had any thoughts about intelligent robotic models or human labor.  
我只是想问一个相关的问题。他还说，我们有 10 年的芯片制造期。是的，我对此感到很惊讶。作为一名劳动经济学家，我觉得有趣的是，我在文献和新闻中看到，这就像一面绿色的旗帜，好吧，如果我们正在展示所有这些芯片制造，这难道不会创造某种蓝领工作的复苏吗？我想知道，你对智能机器人模型或人类劳动力有什么看法？

Well, I don't think it's going to be much of a, I mean, how many of you guys have visited the chip fab, anybody? You guys, some, a few of you have. How many workers were in that fab? Yeah, I mean, well, okay. So the answer is zero.  
我觉得这没什么大不了的，我是说，你们中有多少人参观过芯片制造厂？你们，有些人，有些人去过工厂里有多少工人？是啊，我的意思是，好吧，好吧。答案是零

Like the reason they don't let you, they don't let anyone go in because we humans are too like clumsy and dirty and like, you know, we can't, this just, so it's all robotic. It's sealed inside. So there is like work to, you know, bring stuff to them, et cetera. And if a robot like falls over or something goes wrong, they have to put on, you've probably seen these like, they look like space suits, you know, they have to go in and then they kind of maybe adjust something and then they go back out and hope they didn't break anything. That's, so it's basically lights out.  
他们不让你进去的原因是 因为我们人类太笨拙 太脏了 我们不能进去 所以都是机器人里面是密封的所以有很多工作要做 把东西拿给他们等等如果机器人摔倒了 或者出了什么问题 他们就得穿上 你可能见过像太空服一样的东西 他们得进去调整一下这就是，所以它基本上熄灯。

Yeah, I don't think it's, there are some, there is some like more sophisticated labor required that I don't think it's like a blue collar research. In fact, one of the reasons that Apple reshored MacBook production to Texas is not because labor is so cheap in Texas or anything. It's that they don't actually require a whole lot of labor anymore. So it's a pretty labor, I think. US manufacturing is surging in terms of output, but in terms of employment, it's not really growing all that much.  
是的，我不认为这是一种蓝领研究。事实上，苹果公司将 MacBook 的生产转移到德克萨斯州的原因之一，并不是因为德克萨斯州的劳动力便宜。而是他们实际上不再需要大量的劳动力。因此，我认为这是一种很好的劳动力。美国制造业的产值在激增，但就业人数并没有真正大幅增长。

Yeah. Let's go over here. Yeah. Do you think you have an inflation point coming for agents or text action models in the next year? Oh, yeah.  
好的 我们去那边 Yeah.让我们在这里。好的 Yeah.你觉得明年代理商或文本行动模型的通胀点会出现吗？哦，是的 Oh, yeah.

No, no. Well, he said what Eric, I'm hearing similar thing. Actually, he had a really nice way of putting those three trends. I've heard about them all separately, but I think it was good to bring them all together. Earlier today, I was talking to Andrew Eng, and he's like been beating this drum about agents in particular as being sort of the wave of 2024 where Andrew had a nice way of describing it that like, as you guys know, like if you have an LLM, I don't know, write an essay or something like that, it writes it one word at a time and it just goes through in one pass and writes the essay.  
没有，没有好吧，他说的埃里克，我听到类似的事情。实际上，他把这三种趋势归纳得非常好。我听说过它们各自的特点，但我觉得把它们放在一起很好。今天早些时候，我和安德鲁-英（Andrew Eng）聊了聊，他一直在鼓吹代理是 2024 年的浪潮，安德鲁用了一种很好的方式来描述它，就像你们知道的那样，如果你有一个 LLM，我不知道，写一篇文章或类似的东西，它会一个字一个字地写，它只是一次通过并写出文章。

And it's pretty good. But imagine if you had to do that, like no backspace, no chance to make an outline first. You just kind of go through. The agents now will say, okay, first make an outline. That's the first step you do when you write an essay.  
这很不错。但想象一下，如果你不得不这样做，比如没有退格，没有机会先列个提纲。你就这么写现在的经纪人会说，好吧，先列个提纲。这是你写文章的第一步

And then, you know, fill in each paragraph, then go back and see if the flow is right. Now go back and check the voice. Is this the right level for our audience? Now, you know, and by iterating like that, you can write a much, much better essay or any kind of a task. This is a real revolution.  
然后，你知道，填上每一段，再回头看看流程是否正确。现在再回头检查语音。这是否适合我们的受众？现在，你知道了，通过这样的反复练习，你就能写出更好的文章或任何类型的任务。这是一场真正的革命。

There's all sorts of things you can just do much better if you do that. Then the thing about the context window is also really important. So I'm just going to quote smart people that I know. Eric Corvitz, I was on a panel with him at the GSB. Some of you may have been there.  
如果能做到这一点，很多事情就能做得更好。然后，关于上下文窗口的事情也非常重要。所以，我想引用一下我认识的聪明人的话。埃里克-科维茨（Eric Corvitz），我和他一起参加过GSB的一个小组讨论。你们有些人可能去过那里。

It was last week. And he had this nice taxonomy. People were asking about fine-tuning. I think Susan was asking about fine-tuning. And he said, well, there's really three ways that you can take a model and have it more customized.  
那是上周的事了。他有一个很好的分类法。人们在问微调的问题。我想苏珊也在问微调的问题。他说，其实有三种方法可以让模型更加个性化。

One is you can fine-tune it, which basically like train it some more. Another is with larger and larger context windows. And the third is with RAG or techniques like that that are retrieval augmented generation where it goes and accesses external data. But these context windows seem to be like remarkably effective now. I guess, as Eric was saying, we thought it was hard.  
一是可以对其进行微调，基本上就是再多训练几次。另一种是使用越来越大的上下文窗口。第三种是使用 RAG 或类似的技术，即检索增强生成技术，它可以访问外部数据。但现在看来，这些上下文窗口效果显著。我想，正如埃里克所说，我们认为这很难。

Maybe Peter can explain. But for some reason, we're able to make much, much bigger ones. And now as you can load a whole book or a whole set of books, you can load all sorts of information in there. And that can give you all of the context around it. So that's a pretty big revolution.  
也许彼得能解释一下。但出于某种原因，我们可以制作更大的文件。现在，你可以载入一整本书或一整套书，也可以载入各种信息。这样，你就能了解它的所有背景信息。因此，这是一次相当大的革命。

It opens up a bunch of capabilities that we just didn't have before, including having things much more current, as Eric was saying. Did you want to follow up on that? That's a good question. I mean, there's certainly a lot more capital going in, but that kind of begs the question in the comments, why is all this capital going there as opposed to somewhere else? And I think if you look at the arc of history, sometimes it looks kind of smooth.  
正如埃里克所说，它为我们提供了很多以前没有的功能，包括让我们的工作更加及时。你想跟进这个问题吗？这是个好问题。我的意思是，肯定会有更多的资金投入进来，但这也引出了评论中的一个问题：为什么这些资金都投到了这里，而不是其他地方？我认为，如果你看看历史的弧线，有时它看起来很平滑。

But if you look more closely, there's a lot of jumps. There are certain big inventions and smaller inventions. And Andrew Carparthi was saying that he was playing around with physics. And to really make progress in physics, to be a top physicist, you have to be incredibly smart, study a whole lot. And maybe if you're lucky, you could make some small incremental contribution, and some people do.  
但如果你仔细观察，就会发现有很多跳跃。有一些大发明，也有一些小发明。安德鲁-卡帕提说过，他在玩物理学。要想在物理学上取得真正的进步 要想成为顶级物理学家 你必须非常聪明 学很多东西也许如果你幸运的话，你能做出一些微小的贡献，有些人确实做到了。

But he says that right now in AI machine learning, we seem to be in an era where there's just a lot of low-hanging fruit, that there have been some breakthroughs. And instead of exhausting the space, like picking all the food off of a tree, it's more like combinatorics. In second machinery, they talk about building blocks. When you put two building blocks together, or Lego blocks, you can make more and more. Right now, we seem to be in an era where there's just a lot of opportunity, and people are recognizing that.  
但他说，目前在人工智能机器学习领域，我们似乎正处于一个 "低垂果实 "遍地的时代，已经取得了一些突破。与其说是穷尽空间，就像从树上摘下所有的食物，不如说是组合学。在第二机械中，他们谈论积木。当你把两块积木或乐高积木拼在一起时，你可以拼出更多更多的积木。现在，我们似乎正处在一个充满机遇的时代，人们也认识到了这一点。

And discovery, one discovery begets another discovery, begets another opportunity. And because of that, it attracts the investment. And more people are involved. And in economics, sometimes when more resources go in, you get diminishing returns, like in, I don't know, in agriculture or in mining. Other places, there's increasing returns.  
发现，一个发现带来另一个发现，带来另一个机会。正因为如此，它吸引了投资。更多的人参与进来。在经济学中，有时当更多的资源投入进来 你会得到递减的回报 比如，我不知道是农业还是采矿业而在其他地方，回报会越来越高。

And more engineers coming to Silicon Valley makes the existing engineers more valuable, not less valuable. So we seem to be in an era where that's happening. And then the flywheel of the additional investment, the additional dollars for training, all of that makes them more and more powerful. I don't know how long this will continue, but I don't, you know, it just seems that there are some technologies that hit this really fertile period, and there's positive feedback and some help. We seem to be in one of those right now.  
更多的工程师来到硅谷，会让现有的工程师更有价值，而不是降低价值。因此，我们似乎正处在这样一个时代。然后，额外投资的飞轮、用于培训的额外资金，所有这些都让他们变得越来越强大。我不知道这种情况会持续多久，但我不知道，你知道，似乎有一些技术正处于这个非常肥沃的时期，并且有积极的反馈和一些帮助。我们现在似乎正处于这样的时期。

So people who are trained in getting in the field are making contributions that are often quite significant in a faster time than they might have in some other fields. Encouraging all of you guys, I think are doing the right thing right now. Yeah. Let's take a couple more questions, and then yeah. Okay, how about over here?  
因此，接受过相关领域培训的人往往能比其他领域的人更快地做出重大贡献。我认为你们现在正在做正确的事情，值得鼓励。好的我们再问几个问题吧。好的，这边怎么样？

So not everyone can sit in a room and have all these discussions and debates around AI. And so I'd like to get your thoughts on AI literacy for non-technical stakeholders, whether they're policy makers that have to make it in somewhat informed judgment, or the general public like, you know, using tech. How do you think about explaining technical basics versus discussing abstract implications that don't necessarily have it right in? Well, that's a hard one. I have to say there's been a sea change recently in terms of how much people in Congress and elsewhere are paying more attention to this topic.  
因此，不是每个人都能坐在房间里，围绕人工智能展开讨论和辩论。因此，我想了解一下您对非技术利益相关者的人工智能扫盲的看法，无论他们是必须在一定程度上做出明智判断的政策制定者，还是使用技术的普通大众。你如何看待解释技术基础知识与讨论不一定正确的抽象含义？这个问题很难回答。我不得不说，从国会和其他地方的人们对这个话题的关注程度来看，最近发生了翻天覆地的变化。

It used to be not something that they were interested in. Now everyone's trying to understand it a little bit better. And I think that there are a lot of margins where people can make contributions. They can make contributions in the technical side. But if anything, I mean, my bet is that the business and economic side is where the bigger bottleneck is right now.  
过去，他们对此并不感兴趣。现在，每个人都在尝试更好地理解它。我认为，人们可以在很多方面做出贡献。他们可以在技术方面做出贡献。但如果有的话，我的意思是，我敢打赌，商业和经济方面才是目前更大的瓶颈所在。

That, you know, even if, you know, if you made enormous contribution to the technology side, you still, there's still a gap converting that into something that will change policy. So understand if you're into political science or politician, understanding what are the implications for democracy and for misinformation and power and concentration. Those are things that are not well understood at all. I don't know that a computer scientist is necessarily the right person to try to understand that. But understanding enough about the technology so you know what might be possible.  
要知道，即使你在技术方面做出了巨大贡献，但要将其转化为改变政策的东西，仍然存在差距。因此，如果你对政治学或政治家感兴趣，就应该了解这对民主、错误信息、权力和集中的影响。这些都是人们还不甚了解的东西。我不认为计算机科学家是理解这些的合适人选。但对技术有足够的了解，你就会知道什么是可能的。

And then thinking through what are the dynamics like Henry Kissinger was doing with Eric Schmidt in his book. If you're an economist thinking through the labor market implications, the implications for concentration, the implications for inequality and jobs, implications for productivity and what drives productivity. Those are things that are very ripe right now. And you could go through lots of different fields where there's, you know, understanding well enough what the technology might be capable of. But then thinking through the implications.  
然后像亨利-基辛格（Henry Kissinger）与埃里克-施密特（Eric Schmidt）在他的书中所做的那样，思考其中的动态。如果你是一位经济学家，你可以思考对劳动力市场的影响、对集中度的影响、对不平等和就业的影响、对生产率的影响以及推动生产率的因素。这些都是现在非常成熟的问题。你可以去很多不同的领域，你知道，这些领域对技术的能力有足够的了解。然后再思考其影响。

That's I think where some of the biggest payoffs are. I mean, let me give you a little bit more of a concrete example. And this is something I was going to talk about last week. Electricity was also a general purpose technology. And general purpose technologies have this characteristic that they're part of in and of themselves.  
我认为这就是一些最大的回报所在。让我举个更具体的例子。这也是我上周想说的。电力也是一种通用技术。通用技术有这样一个特点，它们本身就是技术的一部分。

But one of the real powers of general purpose technologies, GPTs as I was saying, is that they give complimentary, they ignite complimentary innovations. So electricity, light bulbs and computers and electric motors and electric motors give you compressors and refrigerators and air conditioning. You can just kind of have a whole set cascade of additional innovations from this one innovation. And most of the value comes from these complimentary innovations. One thing people don't appreciate enough is that some of the most important complimentary innovations are organizational and human capital complementarities.  
但是，通用技术（GPT）的真正力量之一，正如我刚才所说的，是它们带来了互补性，点燃了互补性创新。因此，电力、灯泡、计算机、电机和电动马达给你带来了压缩机、冰箱和空调。你可以从这一项创新中获得一系列附加创新。而大部分价值都来自于这些互补的创新。人们没有充分认识到的一点是，一些最重要的互补创新是组织和人力资本的互补。

So with electricity, when they first introduced electricity into factories, Paul David here at Stanford studied what happened to those factories. And surprisingly, not much. The factories when they started electrifying, they were not significantly more productive than the previous factories that were powered by steam engines. He's like, well, that's kind of weird because this seems like a pretty important technology. Is it just a fad?  
在斯坦福大学的保罗-戴维研究了工厂用电后的情况。令人惊讶的是，并没有发生什么变化。当工厂开始电气化时，它们的生产率并没有明显高于之前由蒸汽机驱动的工厂。他说，这有点奇怪，因为这似乎是一项非常重要的技术。难道这只是一种时尚？

Obviously not. The factories before electricity were powered by steam engines. They typically had a big steam engine in the middle and then crankshafts and pulleys that powered all the equipment. And it was all distributed. But you tried to have it as close to the steam engine as possible because if you make the crankshaft too long, it would break the torsion.  
显然不是。在通电之前，工厂是由蒸汽机驱动的。它们通常中间有一个大蒸汽机，然后是曲轴和滑轮，为所有设备提供动力。所有设备都是分布式的。但你要尽量让它接近蒸汽机 因为如果曲轴太长 就会破坏扭力

When they introduced electricity, he found that in factory after factory, they would pull out the steam engine and they would get the biggest electric motor they could find and put it where the steam engine used to be and fire it up. But you know, it didn't really change production a whole lot. You can see that that's not a big deal. So then they started building entirely new factories from scratch in a new location. What did those look like?  
当引入电力后，他发现在一家又一家的工厂里，他们会把蒸汽机拆掉，然后找来最大的电动机，放在原来蒸汽机的位置，然后点火。但你知道，这并没有真正改变生产。你可以看到，这并不是什么大事。于是，他们开始在新的地方从头开始建造全新的工厂。这些工厂是什么样的？

Just like the old ones. They would take the same model. Some engineer would make a blueprint, you know, maybe take it, make a big X where the steam engine says, no, no, put electric motor here. And they'd go and build a fresh factory. Again, not a big improvement in productivity.  
就像以前一样。他们会采用相同的模型。一些工程师会做一个蓝图，你知道，也许会拿着它，在蒸汽机的地方做一个大的X，然后说，不，不，在这里装上电动机。然后他们再去建造一个新的工厂。同样，生产率也不会有大的提高。

It took about 30 years before we started seeing a fundamentally different kind of factory where instead of having the central power source, you know, a big one in the middle, you had distributed power because electric motors, as you guys know, you know, you can make them big, you can make a medium, you can make them really, really small. You can have them all connected in different ways. So they started having each piece of equipment have a separate piece of a separate motor instead of one big one. They called it unit drive instead of group drive. I went and read the books in Baker Library at Harvard Business School from like 1914.  
大约 30 年后，我们才开始看到一种从根本上不同的工厂，它不再是中央电源，你知道，中间的大电源，而是分布式电源，因为电动机，正如你们所知道的，你可以把它们做得很大，你可以把它们做得中等，你可以把它们做得非常非常小。你可以用不同的方式将它们连接起来。因此，他们开始让每台设备都有一个单独的电机，而不是一个大电机。他们称之为单元驱动，而不是分组驱动。我去哈佛商学院贝克图书馆读了1914年的书。

And it was like this whole debate about unit drive versus group drive. Well, when they started doing that, then they had a new layout of factories where it was typically on a single story where the machinery was not based on how much power it needed, but based on the on something else, the flow of materials. And you started having these assembly line systems. That led to a huge improvement in productivity, like a doubling of productivity or tripling in some cases. So the lesson is not that electricity was a fad or dud and was overhyped.  
这就像关于单元驱动和分组驱动的争论一样。当他们开始这样做的时候，他们有了一种新的工厂布局，通常是单层的，机器不是基于它需要多少动力，而是基于其他的东西，材料的流动。你开始有了这些流水线系统。这极大地提高了生产力，在某些情况下，生产力提高了一倍或两倍。因此，我们要吸取的教训并不是说电力是一种时尚或哑弹，被夸大了。

Electricity was a fundamentally valuable technology. But it wasn't until they had that process innovation, that organizational innovation of rethinking how to do production that you got the big payoff. There's a lot of stories like that. I only told you one of them. We don't want that much time.  
电力是一项具有根本价值的技术。但直到他们进行了流程创新、组织创新，重新思考如何进行生产，才获得了巨大的回报。这样的故事有很多。我只说了其中一个。我们不想花那么多时间。

So I tell you the other ones. But in some of my books and articles, if you look at the steam engine and others, you had similar generational lags decades before people realized that this technology could allow you to do something completely different than you used to do. I think AI is a bit like that in some ways, that there's going to be a lot of organizational innovations, going to be new business models, new ways of organizing an economy that we hadn't thought of before. Right now, people are mostly just retrofitting. I could go through a whole other set of skill changes that are complementary.  
所以我告诉你其他的。但在我的一些著作和文章中，如果你看看蒸汽机和其他技术，在人们意识到这项技术可以让你做一些与以往完全不同的事情之前，你会有类似的代际滞后。我认为人工智能在某些方面与此有些类似，将会出现大量的组织创新、新的商业模式、新的经济组织方式，而这些都是我们以前从未想到过的。现在，人们大多只是在改装。我可以列举出其他一系列相辅相成的技能变革。

I don't know what they all are. You have to be creative to think about them. But that's what the gap is. In the case of early computers, it's literally like 10 times more investment in organizational capital and human capital, if you look at the size of the investments, to the hardware and software. So that's very big.  
我不知道它们都是什么。你必须有创造性地去思考它们。但这就是差距所在。就早期的计算机而言，如果从硬件和软件的投资规模来看，在组织资本和人力资本方面的投资简直要高出 10 倍。因此，这是非常大的差距。

That said, I'm open to adjusting my thoughts on this a bit because ChachiPT and some of the other tools, they have been adopted very quickly and they have much more quickly been able to change things, in part because you don't need to learn Python to the same degree. You can do a lot of things just in English. And you can get a lot of value just by putting them on top of the existing organization. So some of it's happening faster. And in some of the papers that you may have read for the readings here, you know, we had like 15, 20, 30% productivity gains pretty quickly.  
尽管如此，我还是愿意稍微调整一下我的想法，因为 ChachiPT 和其他一些工具，它们被采用的速度非常快，而且能够更快地改变现状，部分原因是你不需要学习 Python 就能达到同样的程度。只用英语就能做很多事情。而且，只需将它们放在现有组织之上，就能获得很多价值。所以，有些事情发生得更快。在你可能读过的一些论文中，我们很快就提高了 15%、20%、30% 的生产率。

But my suspicion is that it will be even bigger once people figure out these complementary innovations. And so that's a long way of answering your question about it. It's not just the technical skills. It's figuring out all the other stuff, all the ways of rethinking things. So those of you who are at the business school or in economics, you know, there's a lot of opportunity there to rethink your areas now that you've been given this amazing set of technologies.  
但我的猜测是，一旦人们发现了这些互补性创新，它的规模会更大。以上就是对你问题的回答。这不仅仅是技术技能的问题。而是要找出所有其他的东西，所有重新思考问题的方法。所以，那些在商学院或经济学领域工作的人，你们知道，现在有很多机会重新思考你们的领域，因为你们已经获得了这套惊人的技术。

Yeah, question. It seems like you're expressing more caution than Eric was with regard to the speed of transformation. Am I correct in saying that? Well, so I would make a distinction between two things. I'll defer to him and others on the technology side.  
是啊，问题。在转变速度方面，你似乎比埃里克更谨慎。我这么说对吗？嗯，我想区分两件事。在技术方面，我会听从他和其他人的意见。

We're going to hear from several other folks. And there are people who are equally optimistic as him or even more optimistic on the technology side. There's also people who are less optimistic. But technology alone is not enough to create productivity. So you can have an amazing technology.  
我们还将听到其他几位朋友的发言。在技术方面，有人和他一样乐观，甚至更乐观。也有人不太乐观。但仅仅依靠技术还不足以创造生产力。因此，你可以拥有一项了不起的技术。

And then for various reasons, A, maybe people just don't figure out an effective way to use it. Another is it may be regulatory things. I mean, some of my computer science colleagues introduced and developed better radiology systems for reading medical images. They weren't adopted because of cultural, you know, people just didn't want them. They didn't want and there are safety reasons.  
然后出于各种原因，一是人们可能没有找到有效的使用方法。另一个原因可能是监管问题。我是说，我的一些计算机科学同事引进并开发了更好的放射学系统来读取医学图像。这些系统之所以没有被采用，是因为文化原因，你知道，人们不想要这些系统。他们不想要，也有安全方面的原因。

When I did an analysis of which tasks I could help the most and which professions were most affected, I was surprised that airline pilots was kind of near the top. But I think that a lot of people would not feel comfortable not having the pilot go down with you. So they sort of you want to have the human in there. So there are a lot of different things that might slow it down significantly. And I think that's something we need to be conscious of.  
当我分析哪些任务我可以提供最大帮助以及哪些职业受到的影响最大时，我很惊讶地发现，航空公司飞行员几乎排在首位。但我认为，如果没有飞行员和你一起坠机，很多人都会感到不舒服。所以他们希望有人类在里面。所以有很多不同的事情可能会大大降低速度。我认为这是我们需要意识到的。

And if we could address those bottlenecks, that would probably do more for productivity than just working on the technology alone. Yeah, question. So Eric had an interesting comment on data centers in universities. I think this is a larger point of like, and I was going to ask him why doesn't he write a check? People are asking him that question.  
如果我们能解决这些瓶颈问题，对生产力的提升可能会比仅仅研究技术更有意义。对，有问题。埃里克对大学的数据中心有一个有趣的评论。我想这是一个更大的问题，我正想问他为什么不开支票呢？大家都在问他这个问题。

Sort of like, what is the role of the university ecosystem? Obviously, there is this larger I'm sure all of the CS professors here. So I'll take I mean, I think it'd be great if there were more funding. I mean, the federal government has something called the national AI resource that is helping a little bit, but it's in like the millions of dollars, tens of millions of dollars, not billions of dollars, let alone hundreds of billions of dollars. Although Eric did mention to me before class that they're working on something that could be much, much bigger.  
大学生态系统的作用是什么？很显然，我相信在座的所有计算机科学教授都有这样的想法。所以，我认为，如果能有更多的资金投入，那就更好了。我的意思是，联邦政府有一个叫国家人工智能资源的东西，它是有一点帮助，但它就像数百万美元，数千万美元，而不是数十亿美元，更不用说数千亿美元了。虽然埃里克在课前跟我提过 他们正在研究一个更大的项目

He's pushing for something much, much bigger. I don't know if it'll happen. That's for training these really large models. I had a really interesting conversation with Jeff Hinton once. Jeff Hinton, as you know, is sort of like one of the godfathers of deep learning.  
他在争取更大更大的目标我不知道会不会实现那是用来训练这些大型模型的。我曾经和杰夫-辛顿有过一次非常有趣的对话。杰夫-辛顿（Jeff Hinton），大家都知道，他算是深度学习的教父之一。

And I asked him like what kind of hardware he found most useful for doing his work. And he was sitting at his laptop and kind of just tapped his MacBook. And it just reminded me there's a whole other set of research that maybe universities have a competitive advantage in, which is not training hundred billion dollar models, but it's innovating new algorithms like whatever comes after Transformers and there's a lot of other ways that people can make contributions. So maybe there's a little bit of a divisional labor. I'm all for and support my colleagues asking for more budgets for GPUs, but that's not always where academics can make the biggest contribution.  
我问他觉得什么样的硬件对他的工作最有用。他坐在笔记本电脑前，轻轻敲了敲他的 MacBook。这提醒了我，大学在其他方面的研究也有竞争优势，比如不是培训价值千亿美元的模型，而是创新新算法，比如《变形金刚》之后的新算法。所以，这可能有点像分工合作。我支持我的同事们为 GPU 争取更多预算，但这并不总是学术界能做出最大贡献的地方。

Some of it comes from ideas and new ways of different perspective about thinking about things, new approaches. And that's likely where we have an advantage. I had dinner with Sendham Melanathon last week. He just moved from Chicago to MIT. And he was a researcher.  
其中一些来自于从不同角度思考问题的想法和新方法，以及新途径。而这可能正是我们的优势所在。上周，我和森德海姆-梅兰纳顿共进晚餐。他刚从芝加哥搬到麻省理工学院。他是一名研究员。

We're talking about what is the comparative advantage of universities? And he made the case, you know, patience is one of them, that there are people in universities who are working on very long term projects. You know, there's people working on fusion. They've been working on fusion for a long time, not because they're going to get, you know, a lot of money this year or 10 years from now, probably from building a fusion plant or even 20 years. I don't know how long it is for fusion.  
我们在讨论大学的比较优势是什么？他提出了一个案例，你知道，耐心就是其中之一，大学里有人在从事非常长期的项目。你知道，有人在研究核聚变。他们研究核聚变已经有很长一段时间了，并不是因为他们会在今年或10年后得到一大笔钱，可能是建造一座核聚变工厂，甚至是20年后。我不知道核聚变还需要多久。

But, you know, it's just something that people are willing to work on even if the timelines are a little further. It's harder for companies to afford to have those kinds of timelines. So there's a comparative advantage or divisional labor in terms of what universities might be able to do. We have just a couple minutes left. This is kind of fun.  
但是，你知道，这只是人们愿意为之努力的事情，即使时间上稍有拖延。对于公司来说，要想在时间上有所突破是比较困难的。因此，在大学可以做的事情方面，存在着比较优势或分工。我们还有几分钟时间。这有点意思。

So we'll just do one or two more questions. And then I want to talk a little bit about the projects. Yeah. Go ahead. I'm Kevin.  
所以我们就再问一两个问题。然后我想谈谈这些项目。说吧 Yeah.说吧我是凯文

I was wondering about the emerging capabilities of AI. It seemed that Eric was leaning more towards the architectural differences and designing better models versus the last class we talked about, Morse law instead. So I'm wondering how you sort of... Well, he said all three. So you guys remember the scaling laws?  
我想知道人工智能的新兴能力。埃里克似乎更倾向于架构差异和设计更好的模型，而不是我们上一堂课谈到的莫尔斯定律。所以我想知道你是如何...他说三者都有你们还记得缩放定律吗？

It had like three parts to it. I think I put the scaling law that Dario and team... So there's more compute, more data and algorithmic improvements, including more parameters. And all three of them, I think I heard Eric say all three of them were important. But not to be dismissed, this last one, like new architectures, all three of them, I think, are being important.  
好像有三个部分我想我把达里奥和团队的缩放定律...所以有更多的计算 更多的数据 算法的改进 包括更多的参数我想我听埃里克说过 这三点都很重要但最后一个，比如新架构，我认为这三个都很重要。

So I think there was another question in there, though, also. How much closer are we to like an AGI type system? So Eric doesn't think we're like that close to AGI type systems, although I don't think it's like a sharp definition. You know, in fact, that was one of the... I was going to ask him that question, but we ran out of time.  
不过，我觉得还有另一个问题。我们离 AGI 类型系统还有多远？埃里克认为我们离AGI类型系统还没那么近 虽然我不认为这是一个明确的定义你知道，事实上，那是...我本来想问他这个问题 但时间不够了

It would have been good to hear him describe it. But when I was talking to him, it's just not that sharply defined thing. In some ways, AGI is already here. Peter Norvig wrote an article called AGI is already here. I don't know if it's in the reading packet.  
如果能听到他的描述就好了。但当我和他交谈时，他的描述并不那么清晰。从某种程度上说，AGI 已经到来。彼得-诺维格（Peter Norvig）写过一篇文章，叫做 "AGI已经到来"。我不知道它是否在阅读包里。

I think if it's not, I'll put it in there. It's a fun little article with Blaise Iarca. And a lot of the things that 20 years ago people would have said, this is what AGI is. That's kind of what LLMs are doing. Not as well, maybe, but it's sort of solving problems in a more general way.  
我想如果没有，我就把它放进去。这是一篇有趣的小文章，作者是布莱斯-阿尔卡（Blaise Iarca）。很多事情，20 年前人们会说，这就是 AGI。这也是LLMs正在做的事情。也许做得没那么好，但它是在以一种更普遍的方式解决问题。

On the other hand, there's obviously many things they do much worse than humans currently. Ironically, physical tasks are one of the ones that humans have a comparative advantage in right now. You guys may know Moravec's paradox. Hans Moravec pointed out that often the kinds of things that a three-year-old or a four-year-old can do, like buttoning a shirt or walking upstairs, are very hard to get a machine to be able to do. Whereas a lot of things that a lot of PhDs have trouble doing, like solving convex optimization problems, are things that machines are often quite good at.  
另一方面，显然有许多事情它们做得比人类差得多。具有讽刺意味的是，体力劳动是人类目前具有比较优势的工作之一。你们可能知道莫拉维克悖论。汉斯-莫拉维克（Hans Moravec）指出，三四岁的孩子都能做的事情，比如扣衬衫扣子或上楼，机器却很难做到。而很多博士都很难做到的事情，比如解决凸优化问题，机器却往往很擅长。

So it's not quite things that are easy for humans and hard for computers and other things that are hard for humans and easy for computers. They're not like the same scale. And next week we have Mira Morati, Chief Technology Officer of OpenAI, briefly the CEO of OpenAI. So come with your questions for her. We'll see you.  
因此，并不是所有的事情对人类来说都是容易的，对电脑来说都是困难的，也不是所有的事情对人类来说都是困难的，对电脑来说都是容易的。它们的规模并不相同。下周我们将请到 OpenAI 的首席技术官米拉-莫拉蒂（Mira Morati），简而言之就是 OpenAI 的首席执行官。带着你的问题来找她吧。我们不见不散。
